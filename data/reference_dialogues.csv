13865434,"Gina: Dear all, I‚Äôm afraid I need to bring up a difficult issue today.
Michael: What‚Äôs the matter, Gina?
Gina: There has been another burglary in the neighbourhood.
Kate: This is terrible!
Daniel: Where was it? This is the third one only this week!
Gina: Fortunately no one‚Äôs been injured. They stole a tv, two laptops and a bit of cash.
Michael: What does the police say?
Gina: Nothing yet, they‚Äôre investigating.
Kate: I bet this is some kind of a gang.
Daniel: A gang? 
Kate: Well, no one can get a tv, laptops and all this stuff on their own.
Gina: Regardless, I think it‚Äôd be a good thing to organise a neighbourhood watch.
Michael: Good thinking!
Daniel: Definitely. I know a friend who did this with his neighbours and it worked out pretty great.
Kate: How did they organise it? Did they have a schedule?
Daniel: Well, basically, they were patrolling the streets twice a day ‚Äì during the day and in the evening, always in twos.
Gina: Could you please talk to your friend so they can help us organise it?
Daniel: Sure, no problem.
Kate: I think that we can also organise a fundraising for CCTV.
Michael: Hm, I‚Äôm not so sure people will be keen on this. They value their privacy, you know.
Daniel: Well, I understand, but I kind of value my safety more.
Gina: It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to bring this up at the next meeting. Saturday is it?
Kate: Yes, I can talk to them. I‚Äôm not a big fan of camera either, but in this case it may be the best solution.
Daniel: Especially as the police is not doing their job. Three burglaries in a week is three too many in my opinion.
Gina: It‚Äôs not an easy case, but I think CCTV may help to catch them if not to scare them away.
Michael: Hm, let‚Äôs wait until Saturday so we can speak to others. We can‚Äôt do anything without their approval.
Daniel: I‚Äôd happily suggest organising the neighbourhood watch."

13731415,"Stephanie: What do you think of what's happening in the UK Parliament today?
Fred: You mean the resignations of four high-ranking ministers over the Brexit deal?
Stephanie: Yes.
Fred: Well, I don't think this deal is going to get signed. Apart from anything else it is worse than simply taking a second vote and hopefully being able to withdraw from Article 50 notice.
Stephanie: Can we even withdraw now?
Fred: Apparently we can do that. There are some opinions that say not, but in reality it would be a big relief to the other countries. 
Fred: The alternative, having no deal at all, is not only risky for the UK, but could cause big trouble to the rest of the states and of course there are quite big issues in the Eurozone already. This could tip over a very big landslide.
Stephanie: So you think we could get a better deal if we hold out?
Fred: Right now the optimal strategy would be to stay inside the EU, forget about leaving as we did not know the hurdles that would be placed by the powers that be. We need to work today with other Eurosceptic countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and the other ex-Warsaw Pact countries.
Stephanie: To do what?
Fred: To change the EU into what we actually want it to be. To radically alter it so that it becomes what we hoped it was going to be.
Stephanie: Can that be done?
Fred: We see that the Germans have had enough of Merkel. When she goes, Macron also goes. It wouldn't take more than one of those bigger countries going the way of Italy, or a few more of the secondary states like Holland and Denmark, from the western side, to start a programme of deep change.
Stephanie: Makes sense. IN the end we all need to have some kind of co-operation in Europe.
Fred: Every Brexiteer I spoke to actually wants A European Union, they just don't want THIS European Union.
Stephanie: But is there any chance that there will be a second vote.
Fred: May has said no, but May could be finished in a week from now. If there is a General Election and all the Conservatives stand on a revote platform with UKIP and Labour saying no re-vote, then the Tories may well win. Then they would have to offer a re-vote.
Stephanie: What if we then end up staying in but other countries start defaulting and leaving us picking up the bills which was going to maybe happen to France and Germany?
Fred: That's the downside risk. Certainly if we are ever going to leave, the time to do it is now, or stay and fight for a different kind of Union which might not need countries to go crashing out of it that way. 
Stephanie: I don't know if you will every find a format that 30 countries will be able to agree on. 
Fred: Either you have to make it so that there is really not that much that they have to agree on, or you make everything so harmonised that it is really one country and everyone is unhappy with something. Where we are now is stuck in the middle, trying to agree and enforce too much, but still with options for countries to do things differently and to look after themselves. We haven't managed to deliver the European dream."

13819864,"Oliver: I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game
Oliver: found two things we were doing wrong today
Chris: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them
Chris: so what we were doing wrong?
Oliver: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P)
Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)
Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting

Farrah: Oh, gee, that's so nice!
Enrique: You have a great collection, you should be proud!
Farrah: I am, but not everyone appreciates it.
Enrique: Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure.
Farrah: If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets!
Enrique: So it's good to share them.
Farrah: Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! It was a fun day.
Enrique: It was for us as well! Will you come back again?
Farrah: Of course! Any time!
Enrique: I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can I give your name and number to that teacher?
Farrah: Sure thing. 
Enrique: I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester.
Farrah: Fair enough. No problem, I understand.
Enrique: Thanks again! It was really interesting!
Farrah: Of course! Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time.
Enrique: That would be great.
Farrah: Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical.

Rachel: Quite well!? That‚Äôs fanfuckingtastic!!! You've obviously got the brains on your side of the family!
Donna: Thanks! Well, what about Jay?
Rachel: 3 Bs, he's over the moon! He's got into his course and all set to be off!
Donna: Russell Group, is it?
Rachel: What, sorry?
Donna: I mean, I assume, he's got into a Russell Group university, I mean the others are ok, but really, you know, not that good!
Rachel: I honestly don't know. He got the grades, was accepted and he's going. Simple as. We're all very proud of him, actually. He's saving up for a car now.
Donna: Well, as long as you're all happy with it, that's fine. We can't all be high fliers.
Rachel: Now, hang on a sec, Donna. You're my cousin and we've always got on well, but I'm not going to put my son down and ruin his happiness just because he didn't get bleeding A* grades! 
Donna: No, of course. I'm sure you've been as supportive as you are able to be. I believe in really pushing children to achieve.
Rachel: God, you are really something, Donna! Jay is a happy, confident boy and I leave him to his own devices because I trust him!
Donna: Well, Oliver has downloaded his reading list already and is working through them. The competition to stand out in law is fierce. A little encouragement wouldn't go amiss for Jay.
Rachel: Ok, I've had enough of this conversation! Jay is well adjusted and people like him. That's more than I can say for Oliver!
Donna: Well, we'll see about that in 5 years time when Oliver is earning 6 figures and Jay is still scraping a living doing his weird so-called art!

Joanna: So what do you suggest?
Paula: I don't know what's wrong with your back, but I'd rather go for sivananda.
Joanna: I tried it at the beginning, but I found it boring to be honest...
Paula: Not if you have a good teacher.
Joanna: Could you recommend me someone then?
Paula: Of course I can! With pleasure!
Paula: I go to Lotus studio, call them and ask for classes with Tina. She's amazing.
Joanna: Thank you! I love doing yoga, I was feeling really bummed out when the doctor told me to quit.
Paula: I don't think that you have to. Maybe you could bring all your medical files to consult?
Joanna: Is this possible?
Paula: There's one therapist, you know, just in case someone's injured. He can have a look and advise you which exercise you can do and which to avoid.
Joanna: That'd be wonderful!"

Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!
Mickey: Srsly?!
Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?
Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today?
Mickey: No.

Jacob: I'm in a lecture about Eastern Europe and the Balkans and I wanted to add something to the discussion, but I always forget which one is Backa and which one is Banat!
Elisabeth: Haha, Backa or Baƒçka is basically the western part of Vojvodina, closer to Hungary.
Jacob: what about Banat?
Elisabeth: it's the eastern part of Vojvodina, bordering Romania.
Jacob: where is the border then?
Elisabeth: I believe that the border between them is the river Tisa.
Jacob: This is super complicated.
Elisabeth: A bit, true. But it's because the West doesn't care about the geography of the East. Western geography is equally complicated, we are just ignorants, hahaha.
Jacob: Do you know why they are 2 regions?
Elisabeth: I am not sure, I think Banat was settled with Germans in the early 18th century, when it was almost empty after a war.
Jacob: What about Backa?

Jane: He definitely wasn't. We were talking, I don't know what's gotten into him
Olivia: I don't know and I don't care. I think you should tell Liz about this. Who knows if he's not cheating on her.

Eli: Yes, but, honestly, it was a waste of time. :/
Scarlett: He‚Äôs not going to plug the hole in the wall, is he?
Eli: Of course he‚Äôs not.
Eli: He said that I have to ‚Äúrepair all damages due to wear and tear‚Äù.
Scarlett: Erm, this pipe didn‚Äôt start to leak because of ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù, so...? You HAD to fix it, you HAD to make this hole in the wall.
Eli: I know, it‚Äôs pure absurd...
Scarlett: Btw your bathroom was in horrible condition to begin with.
Eli: I reminded him about it, but, well, talking to him is like talking to a brick wall.
Scarlett: :/ What are you going to do now?
Eli: I‚Äôm moving out.
Eli: I‚Äôm not going to pay for the renovation of the bathroom, no way.
Eli: I wish I did it earlier.
Scarlett: This is the right decision!
Scarlett: You can stay at my place until you find something. :)
Eli: Thanks, but actually I‚Äôve already found a new flat. :)
Eli: It‚Äôs smaller than the previous one, but it‚Äôs in perfect condition and the rent is much lower.
Scarlett: Cool :) Do you need any help with packing, cleaning up and so on?
Eli: I would really appreciate, if you could help me with unpacking. You‚Äôre so much better at organizing stuff than I am.

Marika: One bus driver got so pissed at a driver blocking in front of his bus 
Marika: So he fought with this driver on the street
Orna: But why so many ambulances, not police cars?
Marika: Cause the driver didn't move his car and the bus driver was so pissed that he pushed that car 
Marika: And then 9 cars as well ahead of that car
Orna: WTF!
Marika: A lot of people got injured
Orna: What a bastard! He couldn't control himself?
Marika: He keeps insisting he wanted to pushed only the first car and suddenly brake didn't work after he did that
Orna: But again, wtf really his job is taking care of the passengers, not driving like a devil from the hell
Marika: That's what I mean
Orna: He is a killer

Marika: I wish him the heaviest sentence!

13820407,"Anne: My cousin is coming this weekend and I would like to take him somewhere nice, any ideas? :)
Tom: Angelo's for sure - best pizza in town, decent prices, nice, classic red-white chequered table cloths style, very Italian!
Anne: Thanks a lot! I was thinking about Angelo's as well, but it happens that my cousin is Italian so I think it may be a bit risky to impress him with an Italian restaurant ;)
Carl: Fair point. What about Toff's? They are famous for having the best fish and chips in the UK.
Anne: Haven't heard about them! Where are they?
Carl: Third zone, near Highgate. The area is beautiful, really worth going, especially if someone's never been to London.
Sarah: If you're looking for something more central, I highly recommend Yori. It's a Korean restaurant, a true gem <3
Anne: What are the prices? It's not that we are really on a budget here, but wouldn't mind saving some for more touristic stuff ;)
Sarah: Cool, I find Yori affordable and their prive-value is really high in my opinion.
Carl: Same for the Toff's, they mainly sell fish and fish and chips, so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first.
Anna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!
Tom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.
Anna: That goes without a question! Have a few places in mind already. He also has a sweet tooth, so I was thinking maybe Hummingbird?
Sarah: I think I may be joining you for that one! If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.
Anna: Always! I always go for the red velvet, even if Tom thinks it's overrated.
Tom: Because it is, it's just a normal cake with red dye in it.
Sarah: So Tom is definitely not going to Hummingbird with us :D Party pooper :P
Carl: How long is your cousin staying?
Anna: Four days so that's four lunches/dinners - waiting for your recommendations!
Tom: Hm... I would also suggest street food on Brick Lane or Borough's Market - if a party pooper may have something to say :P
Sarah: But never on a weekend! Unless you fancy getting stomped or like to waiting for your food like FOREVER. When is he coming?
Anna: Thursday to Sunday, so Thursday after flight it is then. Fortunately, he's flying in the morning. Thank you so much guys!
Carl: Our pleasure, as long as you bring us come cupcakes on Monday :D

Anne: True, she didn't turn up
Sid: and didn't even tell us she wouldn't be there.

Bridget: But the tribal tourism seems to by the big thing now
Tom: How stupid. Those people have been aggressive to everybody for the last millennia, so why would they accept anybody now?
Bridget: Especially one trying to ""bring Jesus"" to them
Tom: exactly, he wanted to be a missionary, or maybe even a martyr
Bridget: God, this kind of things happened hundreds of years ago in Europe. hahah

Tom: They are kind of paradise with at least a few other tribes that haven't been in touch with the rest of the world for millennia.
Bridget: I know, it's fascinating. But it's also very dangerous for them.
Tom: What do you mean?
Bridget: Think what happened to indigenous population of America after they were contacted by Europeans.
Tom: Conquered you mean
Bridget: Sure, but that's not the point. Europeans brought diseases and things that had been unknown in America, like measles and alcohol. They decimated the indigenous peoples.
Tom: I know, that's why they should have protected.

Jim: it is extremely well prepared and presented, even for someone who knows the subject quite well
Jim: I found out a lot from this exhibition
Zac: Would you do anything differently? Do you have any critical remarks to share?
Jim: hmm, nothing really critical. I just had some ideas, what else could be presented or added
Zac: like what?
Jim: they show this beautiful project for Skopje, after the big earthquake
Jim: when Yugoslavia together with the UN prepared a huge plan to rebuilt the destroyed city
Jim: this is a project that became a part of history of architecture and urbanism
Zac: it seems so
Jim: but what is also very interesting is what happened afterwards
Jim: when they abandoned the project, criticised it and most of all the new project - Skopje 2014
Jenny: I heard it's horrible
Jim: it us a nightmare. So Skopje transformed from a city that was planned to have the best architecture in the world to a city with arguably the ugliest, most kitschy buildings
Jenny: this story sounds very interesting indeed.
Jim: yes, but maybe it would be good for another exhibition
Jenny: maybe"

Danny: Yeah, I thought it would all be much more difficult and, of course, that at least one disaster would befall us at some point, which fortunately didn't happen
Juan: It all went smoothly indeed. I think enough people came as well. The only thing I'd wish for would be better networking... But I guess the quality of event attendees is not really something you have much control over anyway lol
Kirsty: lol you're too critical! Some people were nice 
Juan: üôä

Kirsty: Absolutely, don't forget to suggest he applies for a fellowship in a subject opposed to his

Leu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time.
Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.
Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.
Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.
Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?
Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!
Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.
Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.
Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.
Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.
Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?
Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.
Leu: Therapy?
Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.
Leu: Nor can I.
Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.
Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...

13819187,"Victor: Hi everyone! I guess it‚Äôs time for a debrief
Victor: We‚Äôve organised an event, started promotion two weeks before it started. 27 People registered in total and 21 showed up in the end
Victor: I tend to think the event itself went smoothly and the speakers performed well.
Victor: There was some engagement between the audience and the speakers, although for the future I would try and think of strategies to foster more engagement
Victor: Few people showed up for the drinks afterwards, which personally surprised me because that was the part we actually ended up advertising the most.
Victor: And when it comes to our performance as a team, I‚Äôd say everything went smoothly! If I had to think of things to improve though, I‚Äôd say that we could communicate more swiftly and that info necessary for the event to go ahead as planned should be shared so that if one of us happens to be unavailable, busy, etc. others can swiftly take his/her task over.
Victor: I‚Äôd be happy to know what your thoughts are ü§ó
Tony: Heyyyyyyy
Tony: I agree with you on everything lol
Tony: Yer, for the future it‚Äôd be good to start promotion beforehand. I‚Äôm actually still surprised that so many people came in the end
Tony: The point about sharing important info is very much to the point
Tony: ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è
Alice: Hey! Well, thanks to Tony for his relentless efforts to promote the event via Twitter. I‚Äôve followed the ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù and think it was really good
Alice: I don‚Äôt take the thing about info and being busy personally, although I have to recognise I did withhold some info that was much needed and my timing wasn‚Äôt very good either.
Alice: I can take care of setting up a google sheets document where we‚Äôll be able to put important info to be shared w/ other committee members
Alice: What do you think?
Victor: ü§© That sounds terrific actually! Thanks
Victor: And no worries, this was our first event so we knew from the start it couldn‚Äôt be perfect
Alice: üòä
Victor: Well, I think we can congratulate ourselves both on the event and on the nice and fruitful debrief üçíüçåüçâü§£

13864430,"Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?
Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death
Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?
Charles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something
Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:
Monica: <file_other>, <file_other>
Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me
Karen: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine
Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine
Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat

Anne: how could I be so naive
Nadia: I'm not telling you that to make you sad or whatever, but to make you aware of the facts. I was shocked too, to be honest. It seems that he was playing with you, trying to attract her at the same time.

Jenny: Yes, I'd think very carefully about the pros and cons first!
Beth: Yes, I'm going to look around, check Indeed, Reed, etc, other job sites. 
Jenny: I'll keep my ear to the ground, see what's around in town, it would be nice to work near each other!

Polly: We've wondered which is the Queen and which the King suite?
Judith: The Queen is the room next to our office, the one facing our road. The King is downstairs.
Polly: Oh, I thought the suite downstairs was much bigger.
Judith: So it is! That's why we named it King suite.
Polly: I must be damned feminist expecting the best being Queen! ;)
Judith: That's interesting! At the start Bill too was adamant about it claiming that the best should be allocated to Queen. Him being British! But we finally followed the generally accepted definitions of queen-size and king-size, the latter being bigger.
Polly: Good gracious! Now you have corrected my erroneous thinking! Thank you, Judith! Of course a king-size bed is bigger than a queen-size.

Sam: Thanks so much
Penny: by the way how was the museum this morning?
Sam: very interesting. But our guide was such a pain
Penny: really?
Sam: yes she couldn't speak clearly and his german wasn't so good. So we all get bored, and wandered around looking by ourselves
Penny: too bad
Sam: luckily we had lunch in a very cosy restaurant with the girls.
Penny: oh nice. "
13717185,"Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink?
Megan: No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today.
Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen.
Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.
Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P
Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.
Vince: What's the difference?
Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach.
Vince: There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD
Kyle: I prefer the floor. There's more space on it :D
Megan: Just reading this gives me the creeps.
Kyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D
Roseanne: Hey, I never said I can come. My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;(
Vince: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D
Megan: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over.
Roseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us?
Megan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D
Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?
Megan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D
Roseanne: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D
Megan: You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a ‚Äúgirls only‚Äù event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D"

Tomek: Sure thing, as whatever you want
George: For example, what do you guys give to married couple?
George: Random gifts, money...
George: A slap on their butt??
George: :D:D:D
Tomek: So it goes like that: we go to the church for ceremony. After that young couple is receiving gifts from guests, it's in front of the church. Nowadays usually money, typically about ~300 PLN per couple, but if you're short on cash you don't have to give anything, no pressure here. Then you wish them quick divorce and you step back so other guests can make it rain as well ;)
George: So money is right choice
George: Hahhah
Tomek: But you're coming all the way here, I'm sure your presence will be the best gift for them
George: Yeah, nah
George: It wouldn't be a nice thing to do
George: Besides I don't think it's so far
George: It takes an hour and 45 minutes to get there
Tomek: Are you coming with someone? 
George: I'm coming solo
George: Not because I'm cheap"

Mark: the Dungeon something? I've heard about it... have you?
Emily: it's the Dragon's Den, silly! :D yeah, I went there last week with Suzy, the place is insane!
Mark: how so?
Emily: well, for starters, the waiters are dressed like dragons! they have tails and everything! Apparently the owner is this crazy rich guy who's obsessed with dragons. Imagine that...
Mark: That sound really interesting but I was kinda hoping we would go somewhere more cozy and romantic ;)
Emily: awww, you're so sweet! How about we first do the cozy and romantic and see how we feel about the den afterwards?
Mark: Whatever makes my princess happy :) 
Emily: Stop, you're gonna make me blush ;)
Mark: That would just make you prettier... although I am not sure that's even possible...
Emily: You're such a smooth talker! I bet you tell all the girls that! ;)

Phil: If I may recommend something - don't go with Tumblr. It's basically dead.
Vic: Agree with Phil. What are u going to post?
Nancy: What do u mean?
Vic: Text? Pictures? Music? Videos?
Nancy: Haven't really thought about that. I think photos with some comment mostly.
Phil: TBH, any of these will do. U can post photos and comments on Twitter.
Vic: IMHO, Instagram would suit u best. U'd need to work on ur graphics skills though.
Nancy: Y?
Vic: Well, ppl aren't that much interested in what they can read in the comment or description, but in what's on the photo.
Nancy: So the catchphrase would have to be on the photo?
Vic: Basically.
Phil: I can't imagine I'm saying this, but what about Facebook?
Nancy: What about it?
Phil: Well, u can do both! Post pictures and descriptions!
Nancy: Not a bad idea!
Vic: I have an idea!
Nancy: What is it?
Vic: Y not use all of them?
Nancy: What do u mean?
Vic: Well, u can use Facebook in general, Instagram 4 pics and Twitter for rash news!
Phil: That's actually ingenious!
Vic: Right? :)
Nancy: One problem - won't it take up too much of my time?
Phil: Nah! U can use the same post all over.
Nancy: How?
Phil: U post what u want to say on Facebook, the picture on Instagram and tell ur followers they'll find out more on Facebook and a short news on Twitter with the most important info and a link to ur Facebook post.
Vic: And that way u'll get more possible customers :)

Aidy: go on
Connor: let's hear it.
Tommy: It would be about witches a'la new Sabrina, a coven meeting, modern style, but with a victorian twist
Sarah: sounds cute
Tommy: you wanna know the twist?
Aidy: bring it on
Tommy: there are 2 factions - one want's to talk about the future of the coven and are toward more civilized methods, the other is actually totally possessed by demons and wants the other half to sign a pact with them or - if nothing else works - kill them in the end.
Connor: Cool. Does the 1st faction have any suspicion about what's going on?
Tommy: Many people do, but it's not immediately known
Aidy: Hm, might be a bit unbalanced - the 1st faction might be weaker than the 2nd
Sarah: what about a 3rd faction to balance it out?
Tommy: like what?
Sarah: demon hunters in disguise?
Aidy: So then the duel is between the demons and the hunters and the people are still kinda weak
Tommy: They're still mages they can do a lot.
Connor: I don't think the first faction would be weak - it all depends on the mechanics of the game.
Connor: ytou could just as easily make the demons weak, depends on the design
Tommy: these are good point's though, I'll think about it. Would any of you be interested in helping me write it?
Sarah: I might help a bit. 
Aidy: I have my own project now, sorry
Connor: rules-wise yes, otherwise no

Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn‚Äôt watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)

David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don‚Äôt believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.

Bessy: It must have been a shock for you body to be exposed to frost after months of tropical sunshine. Poor dear Mu!
Muriel: And I don't have any single medication left after we'd given everything away in Cuba. Just a rest of nose spray.
Bessy: That should do the trick. If you happen to have fresh ginger, hot ginger tea will sort it.
Muriel: Luckily I got a nice chunk yesterday. How do you prepare it?
Bessy: Sliced fresh ginger steeped in boiling water.
Bessy: I keep shop-bought ginger tea bags as backup.
Muriel: I'll do it immediately. Quite like ginger.
Bessy: If you enjoy honey then it's a great healer for sore throat and cough.

Bessy: And fresh things like oranges, kiwi, grapefruit.
Muriel: Aye madam.
Muriel: This ginger tea tastes superb. I've sweetened it with honey too.
Bessy: Good girl!
Muriel: Do you believe in garlic? Just munching garlic chopped with salt and spread on buttered bread.
Bessy: Not bad. I'd put a slice of tomato on it and toast it in the microwave.

Diana: The one on the Pygmalian?
Larry: yeah
Diana: haven't started it yet.
Larry: ok. what about the hemingway essay?
Diana: er, i think i wrote something along the lines of: ""Throughout the book, it can be observed how the lost generation struggles to overcome their experience with the war"" 
Diana: then i listed a couple of examples
Diana: and THEN i compared those characters to Robert Cohn
Larry: not bad :)
Diana: then I think i ended it with: 
Diana: ""However, in the last few lines of the book, we can see a change in Jake Barnes, the narrator of the book. This is especially noticeable in when Lady Brett says: ""... we could have had such a damn good time together."" This quote suggests that Lady Brett is still focused on the events of the past, which prevents her from persuing happiness. Jake, on the other hand, replies ""Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?"" - a quote which suggests that he has accepted his past and is now looking towards the future.
Diana: It still needs a little polishing though :)
Larry: Has anyone ever told you that you're really good at this kind of thing? :)
Diana: I just pay attention and take notes. Sparknotes help ;)
Larry: yeah, i do too - it's just i can't seem write essays that well :(

13716262-1,"Scarlett: guys, I'm organising a meeting about politics in Central Europe at the ASEEES conference.
Madison: Nice!
Carter: do you need help?
Scarlett: Exactly, I'm looking for some panellists, people with names and knowledge about the topic
Carter: I will ask Pieter Judson, he's very popular now
Scarlett: The historian?
Carter: yes, it's him, he teaches in Florence, Italy now
Scarlett: This would be perfect, he is quite famous now
Madison: oh yes, I've read recently his book about the Habsburg Empire, his claims are fascinating 
Carter: they are, and it's so well written!
Madison: yes, very readable, not academic at all, like a good novel
Scarlett: Could you summarise his claims shortly? I need to know what direction this is going to be able to create a coherent panel. 
Carter: So i would just call it very anti-nationalist. He doesn't believe in nation states and presents the Habsburg Empire as a kind of a predecessor of the EU.
Scarlett: which is not a good prediction for the EU
Carter: not necessarily, Judson suggests that the Habsburg Empire didn't have to collapse as it has been presented so far
Scarlett: by the national historiographies of the successor states?
Carter: Yes, they present the empire as a ""prison of nations"" that had to fall and had been collapsing for a while.
Carter: Judson argues that it was not the case. It is a narrative created post factum 
Scarlett: ok, this sounds fascinating.
Madison: I think you will find a lot of scholars ready to discuss with him
Carter: Sure, and it can be one of the best panels at the conference, easily
Scarlett: Great! So will you talk to him? I have some funding of course to pay for the flights etc.
Carter: Perfect! I will talk to him and let you know
Scarlett: Thanks a lot girls!"

Aria: I barely recognized him!
Maverick: I remember, how you and Kylie used to gossip about him all the time. :)
Aria: Well, we were madly in love with him.
Aria: Or at least we thought so. ;)

Maverick: Everything seemed to be easier, better and calmer back then.
Aria: The world wasn‚Äôt as crazy as it is now.

Katie: yeah but boring doesn't automatically mean that it's bad 
Tori: well, it kinda does when you're me and don't know how to get out of the situation
Katie: haha well I just think your standards might be a little too high 
Tori: lol. my standards are too high cause I don't want someone boring?!
Katie: well nooo, but  I think you should give someone another chance, and not cross them off just cause they came off as boring in the first meeting. Maybe he was just shy!
Tori: oh god. yeah. that's for sure. 
Katie: see, so there ya go. 
Tori: yeah, but if you're so shy and like afraid of me, to the point where I have to keep up the entire conversation, that gets pretty exhausting pretty quick. 
Katie: mm yeah, I know what you mean. but either way, I think you could give him another chance.
Tori: ha, ok. I'll think about it. but just for you, and cause you asked nicely. 
Katie: hahaha ok, thanks, that makes me very happy :)

13828862,"Robin: Appologies, it really irks me
Olive: Fair enough :P So what else do people do that ""irks"" you?
Robin: at work? general bitchiness and a lack of common sence, having to clean up after the previous shift because ""it's not my job"" even though when i do the shift its my job
Robin: ironing as well, now i was brought up wash clothes, hang them on the line let the wind air them and gravity dop creases outt, then ron them, i got chewwed out because i told the lass on nights there were shower curtains on the line, she throws a wobbler about hos its always been my job and she does more work than me and stewart, it was 5 curtains and she'd have finished all her jobs thor the shift in an hour and a half easily
Olive: You really hate your job, don't you... :(
Olive: Do any other employees feel that way though?
Robin: the jobs not bad its just some of the people i work with, yes me and stewart are in the same boat
Robin: he's former rhodesian counter terrorist police, also did firearms for movies like the expendables with schwartzneiger
Olive: And he hates it too?
Robin: has the same irks, sometimes the job is ace, the guest can be great and being aknowleged by them either with a card or tripp advisor is ace
Robin: i just hate what amounts to sexism
Olive: Sorry mate :( Wish i could help
Robin: i'm alright - just nice to chat with someone from time to time...
Robin: Like apparently the cleaners and female night staff have been placing rubbish on the floor to see if I've hovered up, the woman on nights wasn't impressed when I hadn't ironed wet shower curtains fresh out of the wash. She's the one who apparently ""does more than we do on shift"" yet she wont do paperwork that she'd throw her dummy out if it hadn't been done for her 
Robin: And my manager supports her whole heartedly
Olive: Fun fact - the cleaning ladies tick was something that mistresses would do in Victorian times to make sure that the servants were doing their job properly.
Olive: One such trick involved hiding a coin, under a rug - if the servant gave the money back, she was trustworthy. If the servant took the money, the mistress would know. And if the servant missed the coin completely, she clearly wasn't doing her job.
Olive: Now that I've gotten that (interesting, but completely useless) fact out of the way, I think the only thing I can say is: hang in there. Or better yet - don't give them (aka your boss) a reason to fire you.
Olive: Right now, you're in a tough situation because you need the job more than they need you - so, even though it's unfair (and I completely agree with you btw), the only way to win the war is to not let them get you down.
Olive: Man... I suck at giving advice.
Robin: Completely useless information is always useful for pub quizzes, flattered, deffinatly go with flattered
Olive: What about the remainder of my answer... ?
Robin: the advice is good, and your right I just need to push through it, as for military I've not a clue, run with the pups try and rehabilitate my joints and see if theres any career I can do, although im also looking at museum's as a possible career 
Olive: That could be fun - it's interesting, right? :D

Logan: No, it is, because they are saying it isn't legal to exit without another customs agreement or something.
Amelia: See, how can you be sure what anything says right now?
Logan: I'm just reading what the news says...
Amelia: Fake news! LOL!
Logan: Um, right...
Logan: It's the Irish border that's the problem. Ireland is staying in the EU so there has to be a border.
Amelia: Ah, and they don't want a hard border?
Logan: No. Makes everything more complicated and difficult.
Amelia: But this is all lawyer-speak and legalese. 
Logan: Yes, but all lawyers do is give a frank opinion.
Amelia: What does PM say?
Logan: She's insistent that there has to be a backstop for NI and the border.
Amelia: Well, then...
Logan: Some backtracking there, but all in all an honest response from her.
Amelia: The whole thing bores me to tears.
Logan: More to discuss down the pub! LOL!
Amelia: Meet you there!"

Sam: Stop mocking me.
Anna: Stop yourself!

Anna: Please what?... How am I supposed to behave now?
Sam: I don't know. Let's just get back to normal.

Victor: I don't know why she doesn't just give him a key instead of making him wait in the rain.
Susan: Can we invite him to supper, says Jeremy?
Victor: Sure, ask him to come in, give him a sandwich and when I get in then you can invite him to stay for family prayers.
Susan: Good idea. That way he will get to hear a bit of the Bible and learn how to pray.
Victor: Well, that's something he probably doesn't get at his own house.
Susan: Last time he came, he took quite an interest in that story of Elijah and the bears, didn't he?
Victor: Yes, the little chap made me laugh when he said ""I'm never teasing any bald guy again"".
Susan: How has your day been?
Victor: It was OK, not a bad conference. Obviously I am on the train now.
Susan: Hungry?
Victor: Starting to get that way. Obviously it's not worth even having a snack on these trains.
Susan: Did they feed you at lunch time?
Victor: Yes they put out a lot of food, but as I was speaking in the afternoon, I didn't want to eat too much.
Susan: Yes, I know the effect that can have on you, darling.
Victor: Yes, and that's all I need standing up in front of 200 vicars. 
Susan: They'll be saying ""there's that Vic Marshall again, talking through his""
Victor: Darling!!
Victor: What about Little Johnny, hadn't you best be going and bringing him in, if it's raining? 
Susan: Oh! He's not there. His mother's car is parked in the street and she must have let him in.
Victor: Oh well, not today then. We can show him the Lord's favour the next time she comes back late from Lichfield."

13715835,"Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea?
Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now
Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all?
Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer

Lorrie: I know, I know. Remember that nice place near Old Mill? I'd love to have it there.
Jen: Wouldn't we all! That place probably costs a ton! We can try if you want, though. It's good to have a few places picked out, then we'll start calling.

Deirdre: Not too great, actually! Just finished my email to Vivaldi head office.
Sharon: Why, what happened? You usually have a great time.
Deirdre: Well, we do, but the complex has been taken over by new management and they are a bunch of lazy twats, not to put too fine a point on it!
Sharon: Oh my God, what did they do?
Deirdre: How long have you got! First, we booked in and they'd given away the only ground floor apartment available to someone else, so I was cross to begin with. I was watching little Ben like a hawk around that balcony. I did specify ground floor only when we booked too!
Sharon: How irritating!
Deirdre: Exactly! Well, next day, we all decided to go in the pool, James and Ben went in the toddler pool and I took Rosie and Megan in the big one with me as they can swim pretty well. Next thing we know, we have to get out as our eyes are streaming and Ben has grabbed a large floating toddler poo from his pool and is playing with it!
Sharon: That's vile, was it chemicals in the pool that did it?
Deirdre: Yep, far too much chlorine, awful. We could hardly see for a couple of hours and both pools were evacuated immediately, of course! So not a great first day!
Sharon: You poor things, did  everything improve at all later?
Deirdre: Not really! They did have some great entertainment at night, to be fair, but every other night, they seemed to carry on playing music until 2 or 3 am AND we were right over the bar and restaurant. Awful! We did complain, but nothing was done about it.
Sharon: How was the food?
Deirdre: Nice actually, most of the time, but there was so little of it, we were still hungry. The girls being 12 are growing like weeds and need decent amounts. I thought half board would be good, but we had to buy snacks quite a lot of the time to fill the gaps!
Sharon: That Vivaldi lot really are shit! The tv adverts make them sound really high end.
Deirdre: Well, we're obviously asking for compensation, especially because of the chlorine incident. A lot of people are furious, you should see the comments on Trip Advisor!
Sharon: Gosh, I hope you manage to sort it, what a pain!
Deirdre: Yes, we are certainly not going to that place again. Luckily, the timeshares in the UK have all been fab. Anyway, see you next week, Sharon! Cut and blow dry, Tues. at 6pm, wasn't it?

13716880,"Hannah: Hey, girls! Any chance of meeting you this week?
Kirsten: Hey, girl! I'm mostly free this week.
Patty: Hola! I'm free too. And how was Spain??
Hannah: Oh, I'm going to tell you all about it when we meet but in a nutshell - it''s paradise <3 I love it!
Kirsten: just tell us a little bit ;)
Hannah: Okay, so you know we've been there for 2 weeks. It was this beautiful house just 5 minutes away from the shore. We went to the beach almost everyday and you wouldn't believe how clean and warm the water is there. Just wonderful.
Patty: And were was it exactly?
Hannah: It was near Malaga, but not exactly in the city.
Patty: oh, cool, I've been in Granada one time, that's more or less the same region.
Hannah: Yes, it's super close, I've visited it as well.
Kirsten: And how did you get to live in the housre?
Hannah: airbnb
Hannah: but lemme tell you it wasn't easy to find the perfect spot. This house had a great location and was generally very cozy, but it was kinda old. Could have been renovated imo
Patty: but still 5 minutes to the beach <3
Hannah: that was just the best part. I don't remember the last time I was so chillaxed B)
Kirsten: but you said you also visited other places?
Hannah: yea, we took several road trips like the one to Granada, I mentioned. We went to Almeria, Gibraltar. There was this national park we also visited. Generally wasn't all lying on the beach (though for the most part it was ;) )
Patty: sounds soo relaxing...
Kirsten: And were the people ok?
Hannah: They were THE MOST friendly people I've ever met in a foreign country. But it was a good think we knew a bit of Spanish, because most of them - especially the older generations - don't speak English even a tiny bit.
Patty: Yeah, but I remember they're very willing to communicate even if you don't know their language.
Hannah: That's true. Basically I recommend it a lot. Anyways, I hope we'll see each other this week - I'll write you in a couple of days with the details ;)
Patty: ok, can't wait :)
Kirsten: until then ^^"

Martha: I guess I can. I am done with my homework. What did mom want you to buy?
Laura: Well, she wanted me to buy enough groceries for the whole week. Besides meat, some fish and vegetables, we can buy whatever else we want for snacks and breakfast.
Martha: What do you want for breakfast?
Laura: I guess some cereal as usual.
Martha: I do not want cereal every day. I will buy some pancakes and syrup then.
Laura: Get the new Fine Food pancakes in the frozen food section please. I want to see how it tastes.
Martha: Do we still have enough coffee and cream for mom and dad?
Laura: Yes, we do. Talking about coffee and cream, you better buy some milk also. We almost ran out of it.
Martha: Next, what do you want for snacks?
Laura: Some chips would be fine with me. You probably want your chocolate cookies.
Martha: I better write down all these things; otherwise, I will forget them by the time I get to the market. I would hate to make two trips to take care of things.
Laura: Right! As far as meat, mom wants some pork and some chicken.
Martha: Just any kind of pork?
Laura: I forgot to ask mom about that. Anyways, you can ask the butcher for his opinion. He knows what is best.
Martha: How about fish?
Laura: Mom wants some salmon and some catfish. Make sure that they are fresh.
Martha: How much salmon and catfish should I buy?
Laura: Oh, buy four pieces of salmon filet and four pieces of catfish filet. Mom does not like to get the whole fish.
Martha: Are these fish fillets sold by weight or by the piece?
Laura: I am not very sure. Just buy four decent sized pieces. Not too big and not too small.
Martha: ok, let me try it out then,
Laura: sure thing"

Norah: Actually they come home and start to play pretending to be teachers
Norah: Like recreating scenes from the class
Aaron: Wow so they dont feel its enough ;)
Aaron: When you're seven you adore the teacher
Norah: I think that's their way to let off everything that happened at school
Norah: Just to act out
Norah: But in general they like it and I'm glad to see that
Norah: I hated school when I was little
Aaron: Even when you were seven?
Norah: Especially when I was seven
Norah: My sister moved to another school then and I felt bad without her
Norah: She is older but at least I could see her during the breaks
Aaron: So you were a sensitive child
Norah: Like hypersensitive... and extremely shy
Aaron: Well Dylan doesnt like the school at all :/
Aaron: But he is older and should study a lot already
Aaron: All the homeworks, projects... In fact that's a lot of work but that's the way its going to be now... for years ;)
Norah: Do you have to help him with homework?

Gloria: ill? how do you know that?
Kourtney: yes, I've already noticed that people are not very keen to talk to her so I started doing it and we're even talking on facebook
Kourtney: I won't tell what her illness is, but it is serious and now I'm worried :/
Gloria: maybe you should visit her or something
Kim: I don't think visiting her now is a good idea, you cant text her or something, that'll be quicker and safer...she might not be able to have any guests
Kourtney: I feel she will be home tomorrow, maximum in two days. It's not her first visit like that in the hospital
Gloria: it's so sad...you go with the person to the same group and simply know nothing

Wanda: Yeah, I remember! I was shocked, but everyone does it here!
Helena: Here too, only with Scottish accent as well, it did take me a few months to get used to it!
Wanda: You're a lot braver than me, I only went about 15 miles to Leeds.
Helena: Yep, you didn't move out of West Yorks even!
Wanda: Well, I prefer it! I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if I want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer.
Helena: I know what you mean! I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, I exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good!
Wanda: Have you got I to the famous Scottish deep fried Mars bar craze?
Helena: ü§£I have had one, but Edinburgh is a bit posher than Glasgow where it's more popular. Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though!
Wanda: You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when I come visit.
Helena: You bet! When can you make it? 
Wanda: Well, I have two days off lectures at the end of next week and I can swap my shifts around if I do it tomorrow. I reckon I can train it up next Thurs if that suits you.
Helena: Should be fine! I have got lectures Friday mind, you could try a bit of sightseeing, perhaps?
Wanda: I would love to see the Castle and the National Art Gallery, have a wee look round too, hen!
Helena: Don't start trying to act all Scottish, you sassenach!
Wanda: Not sure what that means, but you're a Yorkshire lass too and you do it!
Helena: Yes, but I'm an adopted Scottish person now. I'd really like to stay on here, maybe do a PGCE.
Wanda: You a teacher! You haven't got the bloody patience to deal with kids all day!
Helena: Maybe, but it's an idea I've been toying with, convey my passion for history to the young!
Wanda: Hopefully, the young will share your enthusiasm!
Helena: Well, we'll see, still got over a year to decide!
Wanda: Think about it carefully, my sister teaches Geography over in Brighouse, as you know. She's only been doing it 3 years and she feels burnt out at the end of term!
Helena: Oh yeah, forgot about that! Anyway, keep me posted about next weekend, can't wait to see you if you can manage it!

Greg: he's a great player
Greg: so we should be happy if we get him
Steven: but at what cost?
Steven: from what I read they prepared to give up almost everything for him
Greg: he's a superstar
Greg: I don't think they'll let him go for close to nothing
Steven: I know but that's not the point
Steven: we'll end up with LeBron, Davis and some subpar roleplayers/vets
Greg: Magic should know what he's doing
Steven: not so sure about that
Steven: giving up Lonzo, Kuzma, Zubac and Ingram plus some picks just to get Davis seems a bit too much
Greg: with both LeBron and Davis we should be able to attract more roleplayers and maybe a third superstar during free agency
Steven: I hope you're right
Steven: sometimes I have a feeling that people forget that you still play basketball with 5 players on the court not 2
Steven: no matter how good they are
Greg: maybe but it's something beyond our control
Greg: and having both Davis and James on the team would put us back in contention
Greg: no matter how good LeBron is he won't win by himself
Steven: maybe
Steven: but I liked how they were developing young players
Steven: it would be sad to see almost all of them gone in just one trade
Greg: the trade still didn't happen so at the moment is pure speculation

Julia: Ok, so we're in this Flamingo bar, we have the whole bar just for ourselves, I don't remember who was there, but I remember you, Christa, Paula? I think Mike was there as well
Julia: Everyone was sitting on the floor, there were cushions everywhere, you know, this exotic, Arabic style. The whole atmosphere was very bohemian, the cushions, smoke in the air, people laughing
May: Wow sounds nice, not like Flamingo at all ;)
Julia: I know! I was really excited because I spotted Mark when we arrived. We went for drinks, people were sitting in groups, some were talking, some were playing boardgames, so we tried to mix with the group Mark sitting in
Julia: we approached them, squeezing through the crowd and then I saw Tom Hiddleston seating with one of the groups
May: you what?! XD damn
Julia: told you it's crazy :D
Julia: Surprisingly enough I wasn‚Äôt that surprised by it and was still more stressed about talking to Mark XD We didn‚Äôt make it to Mark‚Äôs group as it was too crowded and there was no space next to them, so we had to settle with the group Tom Hiddleston was seating with

It will be public so I dont want to make grammar or vocabulary mistakes :P I'd be thankful if you saw it and improve it as a native speaker :)
Nancy: Hey! Of course - no problem :D Just send me what you wrote and I'll look through it ;)
Nancy: How are you btw?
Ida: Its time to say good bye! During my Hamburg experience I had fun, I worked hard and I took a lot of walks in the harbour. I also realised that #Fischbrotchen and milkshake are not a perfect match. But most of all - I met incredible, inspiring and freindly people who gave me the best memories. Thanks for everyone, who made me smile! + special thanks for my sister who survived 5 months with me and my Netflix obsession.
Ida: Thanks a lot: Here it is (some cheesy jokes included, but I didnt want to sound too pompous XD )
Ida: I'm fine, tomorrow I'm leaving Germany ;) But i miss France actually :D What about you? Still studying in Bordeaux? ;)
Nancy: Hey, I couldn't answer you straight away - here are my corrections:
Nancy: It's time to say... It's = it is; Its = possessive form of it, meaning ""of it"". 2 examples  - 'The building was missing its windows.' and 'it's a lovely day outside!'
Nancy: ""Goodbye"", not ""good bye"" ;)
Nancy: This is such a petty thing for me to correct, but here goes - ""During my Hamburg experience , I had fun..."" (what can I say? Commas are important too :P )
Nancy: I took a lot of walks *on* the harbour - just like you would say: ""I took a walk on the beach"" not ""in the beach""
Nancy: Milkshakes - plural (especially since you next write: milkshakes *are* not ""is"")
Nancy: Thanks everyone who made me smile - the ""for"" isn't needed, if anything, ""thanks to everyone"" is preferred. And *a* special thanks *to* my sister - again, ""to"" not ""for""
Nancy: And that's about it :P Hopefully this makes sense ;) But other than some really minor mistakes, I would say that you're in pretty good shape language-wise 
Ida: I had a great teacher ;) 
Ida: Thank you very much! <3 Even in French I double-check what I write if it goes public XD
Nancy: You're very welcome :) To answer your earlier question, I'm doing okay - it's been a bit bsy at the moment, but nothing I can't handle :P WHat have you been doing in Germany?
Ida: I did an internship at About You! Do you know this company? It's pretty new in Europe. So I was taking care of the french market
Ida: Do you have exam session? o.O
Nancy: That's great Ida! I haven't heard of it, but it sounds like you learned a lot and had fun :)

Nancy: Thanks :) So, what's next on the cards for you after you return to Bordeaux?
Ida: About you is an online shop,just like Zalando XD So i bought thousends of new clothes
Ida: Next semester ill focus on my uni. I have to make 2 semesters i one - so 17 exams in June... :O

Gina: Hi there! Can't complain. Just enough commissions to keep me busy without overworking. Enough money too. And you?
Mash: I still work about 12-15 hours a week, which with my rental means that I am not dipping into my savings too much.
Gina: Sounds good. Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?
Mash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year‚Äôs editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.
Gina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?
Mash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?
Gina: Tina?
Mash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.
Gina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?
Mash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.
Gina: Has she retired yet?!
Mash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.
Gina: And you, old man?
Mash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.
Gina: And the estate? The rents?
Mash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze
Mash: D‚Äë':
Mash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don‚Äôt work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.
Gina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.
Mash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.
Gina: Good old Mash!
Mash: It's me!
Gina: How grand to hear your news! 
Mash: You must come and visit me again.

I would like to ask if there have been any news about tomorrow's classes. Everyone is wondering whether they should come to the university tomorrow or not. Thank you in advance for any information. Kind regards, Alice
Margaret: Good evening, all classes will take place according to schedule tomorrow, so no good news for the students! :) By the way, I would really prefer if students wrote to me on my email address.
Alice: I know, I apologize
Margaret: Ok, just remember in the future.
Alice: It's just we got used to communicating with Dr. Smith via Facebook, he uses it all the time
Margaret: I know, Dr. Smith has a very informal approach, however I happen not to share his views.
Alice: Ok, sorry again, Professor!
Margaret: You know I only answered here because you are older than your fellow students, had it been one of the others I would have told the rascal to send me a proper email message. ;)
Alice: I know, I apologize once again
Margaret: No problem, see you tomorrow!
Alice: Have a nice evening
Margaret: You too.
Alice: Oh and may I ask you one more thing?
Margaret: I feel like I'm being forcibly Dr. Smith-ized here.

Alice: May I ask you if you have read the second chapter of my thesis? I hope it's good but I'm not sure...

Alice: Ok, thank you very much, Professor!

Victoria: Oh my god, thanks! I was just about to buy tickets from them
Lucas: I did it once, I'm telling you, it's a scam - paid a lot of money, never saw the ticket or my money back
Victoria: I'm looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons, but they're gone everywhere :( Thanks for the warning though
Victoria: It was the only page that had them available - in good price. I also found some on Viagogo, have you heard about it?
Daniel: Huh, I did. I had the same problem with Guns'n'Roses concert last year, there were only some tickets left on Viagogo and I bought two - it was a scam as well
Lucas: They have legit tickets sometimes, some of my friends used it before, but it's nothing sure. It didn't work for me
Patricia: Yeah, I had a problem with Viagogo as well. I don't know how it works really, but I got scammed as well. Buying tickets from people on Facebook worked better for me
Victoria: But how can I find them? It's really my last resort :(
Patricia: Find the official event of the concert and ask around. Maybe some people can't come and they're already selling their tickets
Daniel: It's risky as well, but I think it's better than some dodgy website. On Facebook you at least have the name of the person who's selling
Patricia: It's also good when you can buy a ticket from someone who's from the same city - you can just meet and exchange
Lucas: Yeah, so someone won't wander off with your money!
Victoria: Why it has to be so difficult? :(((
Victoria: I'll try it out guys, thanks!
Lucas: Next time you can set a reminder
Victoria: Oh, where?
Lucas: Every webpage has a reminder option. You give them your email address so they can contact you to let you know that the tickets are on sale
Victoria: Thanks! This time I totally missed it, I was away, but I would never have thought that they'll be gone within an hour
Patricia: An hour?! Wow, that's quick!
Patricia: When I was buying tickets for Ed Sheeran I was refreshing the page 30 minute before it started
Daniel: It is a pain, but I think it's a trend now - you buy tickets a year before the event, otherwise you're stuck with dodgy solutions
Victoria: I'll let you know if I find some tickets, already posted in Facebook that I'm looking for two, at least one :)
Lucas: Good luck! Be careful though ;)"

Rob: Yeah, I know. Plus I can always get a small loan and pay it off slowly.
Gina: Better than waiting till 2022. Is it painful?
Rob: I have no idea. It would be arthroscopic surgery, so it's minimally invasive, I guess.
Gina: Ok, that's not too bad. My uncle's had arthroscopy done. He was out and about 2 days after he got out of the hospital.
Rob: Hmm... that doesn't sound too bad. I've read a lot of blogs on it. Everyone says something different.
Gina: I don't think you should worry too much about it. What can happen if you don't do anything?
Rob: Well, it could get a lot worse, damaging other parts of the knee. Plus I avoid certain movements now. I'm afraid of the knee locking up, and that's PAINFUL!
Gina: That's not good. Just sign up for the surgery. I can help you out a little with the cost.
Rob: It's ok, don't worry. I'll go to the bank and get a loan.

Julian: no they are not, which is cool and worrying! 
Hetty: yeah of course. Do they attack humans?
Julian: Not really, they generallyare too scared. there have been reports of city foxes nibbling on little kids in cots though üò± 
Hetty: yuk! that's pretty scary!
Julian: Yeah I guess they are predators when given the opportunity!

Hetty: so what are they doing in your garden? what do they eat?

Hetty: they are quite beautiful aren't they
Julian: I think so!  pretty cool!
Julian: some people feed them in their garden to have them come back, but I don't think Tinkerbell would like that much!

Ava:  Exactly, and I don't really want to do that.
Isabella: Ha, well then good luck with that.
Ava: Well, I just thought, everyone always has things that they would need
Isabella: I dunno, I think my mom has absolutely everything she could ever need.

Isabella: THAT IS SO MUCH WORK
Ava: ha, well yeah, who would have thought gifts should be thoughtful
Isabella: mm no I feel you, I hate going to the mall
Ava: especially now during the holiday season
Isabella: my solution for that: ONLINE SHOPPING 
Ava: yeah, that can be better instead of walking around a million stores, but I don't really like online shopping either 
Isabella: How come?
Ava: Because I like to see what I'm buying, and you just never know what something will actually be like in real life
Isabella: Yeah, that could be the problem with clothes, but usually other stuff seems fine for me
Ava: Yeah, I guess it just depends. But anyway, I'm writing because I wanted to ask you if there was anything specific you'd like this year. I don't want to buy you something random that you don't need. So let me know if there is anything specific you need and I would be really excited to get it for you.

Greg: how did they calculate this?
Phil: and I cannot tell if it makes sense to have wool clothes and waste their milk
Coco: point taken
Greg: those numbers seem kinda off to me
Greg: but vegan milk is about cruelty-free life, not reducing carbon footprint
Phil: reducing carbon emissions is key to our survival so yeah it matters

Phil: think about the carbon footprint of glass bottles and plastic packages
Greg: can you buy milk in glass?
Coco: I've never seen vegan milk in glass bottles
Coco: that's shitty
Phil: it depends what matters the most for you
Phil: vegan milk is cruelty free while the lowest footprint is related to local stuff
Greg: so it's better for carbon footprint to drink milk of animals that will be totally used
Phil: ironically, yes
Phil: if you wear leather it make sense to drink milk too
Greg: and use soaps with animal fat
Coco: there's soap with animal fat? wtf

Tim: ok, great. Do you want to focus on anything in particular? Because how are we dividing this project?
Samantha: I think I'd like to talk about the history of the concept - like what was before Darwin and then about his idea in the ""origin of species"" 
Tim: I've actually just finished reading the selfish gene by Dawkins and I would like to incorporate some of the stuff from the book. 
Samantha: Oh cool, was it good?
Tim: Great even. I've always thought it's a shame that he's mostly known as the chief atheist when he's really a brilliant biologist. 
Samantha: I've always kinda associated Dawkins with the atheist stuff tbh I've only recently found out about his scientific work
Tim: Yeah, many people do that and it's a shame. You know that he coined the term meme?
Samantha: oh cool, i had no idea. 
Tim: so it would be great to talk about he's ideas in the presentation 
Tim: *his
Samantha: sure, you can talk about the modern understanding of natural selection and include Dawkins there 
Tim: So I would give like the modern definition of it
Samantha: Yeah, seems like it. If you want. 
Tim: sure, can do that. What else do we need? 
Samantha: So we have - the history, the actual modern definition... maybe the evidence? We could mention like... you know, all the things they've dug up ;) 
Tim: yes, the fossils and all that. 
Tim: That's a good idea. And then maybe why it's important? Like how it changed science?
Samantha: oh, that would be good - why it matters when it comes to our understanding of humanity's development, origin etc. 
Samantha: So you wanna take that part?
Tim: Yeah, could be interesting. 
Samantha: So I'll take the evidence part. 
Tim: Great. It seems evenly divided.

Dieter: Good to hear from you, Wolf. We thought you were already there. Yes, I know how difficult it is to go online in Cuba. But they do have so called hotspots.
Wolf: I understand these are just public spaces where you can get connection but you have to buy a credit that seems to be quite expensive. We will do that but not more than once a week or so.
Dieter: Don't bother then texting us. We'll catch up on the news later.
Dieter: When are you back in the online world?
Wolf: On 4 January. Cancun, Mexico.

Dieter: Thanks for sending us an email with the update of your whereabouts. Fantastic pictures!
Dieter: Helen says it looks as if you both have lost some weight.
Wolf: Not really. Not yet. But surely we will in Cuba.
Dieter: ?
Wolf: Food shortages, food rationing, black market - you name it. We've heard the folks there are queuing for bread. They have restaurants though, but we hear the offer is rather modest.
Dieter: Sounds a bit of a challenge but it can't be that bad.
Wolf: Hope not. And losing a few pounds won't be bad either. And there is always Havana Club!
Dieter: Try the 7 year old one. To my taste it can compete with mid range cognacs.
Wolf: We'll try them all. Mary is also looking forward to trying out a Cohiba. If we can afford it!

Wolf: Out of question!! Better ways to ruin one's health.
Dieter: Come on! You are on holidays! Enjoy it and stop counting money. Cuba isn't that expensive after all.
Wolf: Wrong! Tourists are forced to use special currency and pay special prices. We'll see how expensive or cheap it really turns out to be.
Dieter: Anyway I hope you'll have a great time in Cuba. We wish you all the best for this lag of your journey.

13828486,"George: Do you intend to watch the second season of OWL?
Mark: When does it start?
George: February 14th.
George: They made lots of changes to the stages but with the addition of the new teams it's pretty understandable.
Mark: I guess the hours didn't change much?
George: From what I'm seeing not really.
Mark: That sucks.
George: Well they are still based in the US so the hours are chosen accordingly.
Mark: Doesn't change the fact, that it sucks :P
Mark: For us it basically means that if you want to watch all the matches live, you need to pull an all-nighter.
George: Yeah, last season I basically watched it only on Fridays and Saturdays.
Mark: Still rooting for London?
George: Yeah, there are some new interesting teams but for Europe they only added Paris, and for me UK>France.
George: Besides they won it last time, so it would be weird to switch ;)
Mark: I was tempted to switch after last season disaster.
George: Dynasty?
Mark: Yep and they didn't even make the playoffs, talk about a let down.
Mark: But I will give them one more chance :P
Mark: They did make some roster changes but I'm still worried about the second dps spot.
George: They got new coaching staff so dps might improve.
Mark: I hope so. I never thought I could be so disappointed over a gaming tournament.
George: Times change :P
Mark: Might be true, but one thing seems to be always the same...
George: And that is?
Mark: All the teams I support end up in a slump!
George: Start supporting the ones you want defeated ;)
Mark: That might be an idea...
Mark: Not sure if a good one but an idea nevertheless :P"

Dominic: Actually it is possible and there's nothing you can do about it but wait
Dominic: The weather is putting your patience to the test :D
Laura: It seems so...
Laura: My mom says that it's good for me because I spend too much time at the computer

Chloe: I mean everything became crystal clear after the 1st lesson with u.
Liam: I'm happy I could help.
Liam: But without ur determination & mathematical intuition my help wouldn't have sufficed.
Chloe: I couldn't grasp anything in class.
Chloe: Mr. Anderson made me so nervous, he was a complete blocking point.

Liam: I know what u mean. He wasn't my favourite prof. either.
Chloe: The teacher makes such a difference!
Liam: That's true.
Chloe: I'm so happy I have that behind me now.
Chloe: But this small success is definitely not changing my mind about math. I'm definitely heading towards humanities.
Liam: I get ur point. U really need to be passionate about what u choose 2 study at uni.

Debbie: You know that Abigail from Chalfont?
Ruth: The one whose father is a pastor?
Debbie: Yeah. That one. You won't believe it, but she is pregnant.
Ruth: You are joking?  
Debbie: I'm not. She is showing already.
Ruth: Of course, her parents are never going to let her have an abortion, so that's it for her, game over.
Debbie: and the shame for them, him being a pastor and everything. Word is, he will have to give up being a pastor as he didn't bring his kids up right.  So they are going to be out of the house they have, he isn't really trained for anything else, it's a complete disaster.
Ruth: Bloody hell, I feel bad for them. Can't the church help them out a bit? Its not very Christian, is it, just chucking him out.
Debbie: I agree. They say he has brought scandal but they are the ones who are making this a scandal.
Ruth: Silly girl, though. She's caused no end of trouble. Who's the father anyway?
Debbie: You know Trevor. She has been seeing him for a while. Only in secret as her dad wouldn't let her go out with anyone.
Ruth: Is he standing by her?
Debbie: Yes, he wants to do the decent thing and he says he wants to marry her, but his family are all upset because he was supposed to be going to Uni and now he won't be able to. He will have to start work. His dad will give him a role in his buidling firm as an apprentice.
Ruth: It is a waste of his career.
Debbie: Some people say he is lucky. Abigail is a very nice girl, they clearly do love each other, and he was going to do a useless degree on history and now he will learn to build houses and end up with no student debts and probably as rich as his own dad in ten years from now.
Ruth: Really? So Abigail probably made a logical move then.
Debbie: I doubt she was thinking with her brain, but in fact it should be ok  for her. Its her family and her old man not having a job because of it which is the one to be pitied, I suppose.
Ruth: Maybe Trevor's dad will be able to give Abigail's Dad a job as well?
Debbie: Her mother earns quite well as a bookkeeper, so maybe they will be OK, but it is sad that he won't be able to work at his calling any more.
Ruth: They should just send him to be pastor in a new place, where nobody will hear of this.
Debbie: Yeah. Like the Outer Hebrides. "

Mousie: A seamy side of democracy.
Mousie: Have you heard the latest? About the mayor of Gdansk?
Mousie: <file_other>
Joddie: NO!!! Why murdered?
Mousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.
Joddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?
Mousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!
Joddie: Who said so?
Mousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.
Joddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?
Mousie: <file_other>
Mousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.
Joddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.
Mousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.
Mousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!
Joddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!
Mousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!

Ruby: Omg no hard same, I hate it. I always find it hard to connect with a book if the protagonists are literal garbage, and Heathcliff is the worst.
Jax: before i read it I thought it was a romace novel but now i see that i was horribly deceived
Jax: heathcliff needs to meet my mum. my mum would kick his arse
Ruby: And how many narrators does one book need?
Jax: and why is the narrator narrating the narrator?
Ruby: I DON'T KNOW but it's the most irritating narrative structure I've ever read.
Jax: and wtf is up with catherine always locking herself in her room and making herself ill when she doesn't get her way? kids are mre mature than that. i am more mature than that
Ruby: It really pisses me off that Heathcliff abuses Isabella, but even in this day and age we're supposed to believe he's a Byronic hero, like, okay, sure, let's side-sweep the abuse because he's tragic or whatever.
Jax: i wasn't aware that it was okay to abuse women if you could pull of standing around the moors but i guess heathcliff has paved the way
Ruby: LMFAO
Jax: the woman i love is dead. should i kidnap her daughter? i guess it's fine because i look really spiffing in breeches and a cravat
Ruby: The thought of you in breeches and a cravat is hilarious.
Jax: you mean HANDSOME and also  OVERWHELMINGLY HANDSOME
Ruby: And the caps finally make an appearence.
Jax: weirdly i used to date an isabella
Ruby: You did?
Jax: yeah for like two years
Ruby: You did?
Jax: yeah for like 2 years
Ruby: Wow. I've never dated anyone for that long.
Jax: how long have you been with your boyfriend?
Ruby: Oh. Just over a year I suppose.
Jax: you suppose?
Ruby: Things with him have been sort of shit for a while so I don't really like thinking about it.
Jax: oh
Jax: i'm sorry, i didn't realise
Ruby: I'm at his flat now. His mates are here. He didn't tell me they'd be watching football so I'm sitting here with nothing to do.
Ruby: TBH I don't even know why I'm here because one of the guys who came over once tried to grope me and I've felt really uncomfortable around him ever since.

Robert: Yes, everybody believes that the EU will survive and everything will be fine
Barbara: Exactly. But we all know what those people are about, what they want.
Barbara: Just like with Hitler. I've recently read an article from an American newspaper from 1930s. The journalist was arguing that Hitler would be civilised soon and won't implement his sick plans. in fact he only got worse
Elizabeth: So you think we are heading for a catastrophe?
Barbara: Yes, I think we should understand that we're heading there. Why should it not happen? It's just a logical result of what's happening now.

Sandra: I've heard people were going out of the screening because it was too much
Brian: Yeah, he's famous of doing films to hard to handle

Brian: Bored? At the trailer? How long is it? 2 minutes? :D
Jane: Hahahaha, it wasn't too long :P
Jane: I was bored because it was boring. That's why I think I'm just getting old. A couple of years ago I would be crazy excited about this film.

Sandra: I think I get what you mean
Brian: Maybe it's different and you should give it a shot? The same rule applies to films about love
Jane: I guess so, but I now kind of enjoy more films in which people don't murder each other
Jane: Maybe it is the age thing after all, I don't think I can handle all those negative emotions to that extent
Sandra: I never liked films like that exactly because of that
Sandra: You can just watch daily news instead of an horror

Mel: right, that's odd
Maxine: I know right, do you think so as well?
Mel: that's a total beginners course right? Why did she say she put you forward for it?
Maxine: she was really vague about it, saying that it would be a good refresher type of thing. 
Mel: but that's what is offered to new staff, you have been here for ages!
Maxine: I know, I even did this course or the old version two years ago
Maxine: It just felt a bit patronising to be honest...
Mel: do you think she is punishing you for that hassle with the handover last summer?
Maxine: it feels that way a bit, but that would be mega unprofessional right???
Mel: yes. what else could it be though? really weird!
Maxine: I know, I don't really know what to do now...
Mel: Maybe have another word?

Andy: <file_photo>
Andy: Very pretty, isn't it?
Mummy: Oh my gosh! It looks as if you're snowed in! How did you get to work?
Andy: Took a bus but it got stuck on the first roundabout due to a major accident with a few cars. Was late nearly 2 hours. But so was our boss :))
Mummy: At least you had sense enough not to try to get the car out.
Andy: Totally impossible. Maybe Lennie will try to clear the drive this afternoon.
Mummy: Well, you will need the car to do the shopping, won't you?
Andy: Dunno really. It's Lennie's business. I think he'll have it all done by home deliveries.
Mummy: Isn't he a bit too easy going with your money? He doesn't earn that much himself.
Andy: I don't mind at all. We've got more than enough anyway. He bought a Xmas tree yesterday and it's on the terrace now.
Andy: <file_photo>
Mummy: No decoration yet?
Andy: We'll do it over this weekend. It will be beautiful when you come. I'm really looking forward to your staying with us over Christmas.
Mummy: We are very happy about it as well. Dad has already bought our rail tickets, with place reservation. By the way, don't bother about picking us up from the station if the weather stays like this. We'll take a taxi.
Andy: Not a bother at all! By the time you're coming all that snow will be gone.
Andy: Hey Mummy. I'd better stop texting now as I still want to have a bite before getting back to work. I'll call you tonight, ok?
Mummy: Oh, is it your lunch break?! I thought you were back in your office by now. Sorry to have kept you! My poor hungry son!
Andy: That's really nothing Mum. Lovely having talked to you. Till later!
Mummy: Love you!
Mummy: Oh by the way, tell Lennie we'll be bringing the turkey. Or I'll talk to him tonight."

Christina: come on, you know who's going to be there and here I come, dressed like an idiot.
Martha: You don't have to dress up as an idiot :P
Christina: Hahaha, very funny. I haven't bought that amazing black dress not to wear it now when there is finally an occasion.
Martha: So wear it, I don't get what all the fuss is about.
Christina: But hasn't Stacy said that dressing up is obligatory? I don't want to be a party pooper ;/
Martha: Hm, don't remember, but even if, she can't really force you?
Christina: Well, no, but I'll stick out like a sore thumb if I am the only person who didn't dress up
Martha: you kind of will :D Come on, dressing up is fun.
Christina: ... so fun
Martha: And here I was thinking that maybe we could coordinate in a funny way like Batman and Robin or something like that :D
Christina: I bet I could definitely win James' heart dressed like Robin or Batman :P
Martha: hahaha you'd be surprised, guys like chicks with sense of humour
Christina: yeah, if they're in tight minidress
Martha: You do what you want. You can always dress up for someone sexy
Christina: but I don't know how :( I don't have any idea.
Martha: If you REALLY need to wear that black dress dress up for Maleficent or Audrey Hepburn, don't know
Christina: hm... I look them up
Martha: oh my god Chris, love you lots but do you really need to look them up to know how they look like? :D
Christina: hahaha, so funny :P
Christina: wow, you should've told me Angelina Jolie played Maleficent, that could work :D
Martha: Good that we have one thing figured out :P Tell me if you're going to bring something to eat, not sure if I should buy or, the dread, make something :<
Christina: Wine for me, thanks :D"

Samuel: My apologies. 
Tim: So what is your language?
Samuel: It is Telugu, brother. 
Tim: is that spoken in India?
Samuel: Yes, in South east India. Bangalore and Chennai and other places. Nearly 90 million speakers, brother.
Tim: Is it one of those written right to left?
Samuel: No, it is written left to right. It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same.
Tim: Wow. 
Tim: So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland?
Samuel: It is 23 provinces, Anna. But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month.
Tim: So what is the word for ""younger brother"" if ""Anna"" means ""elder brother?""
Samuel: Thammu or Thammadu. You can call me Thammu. I am younger than you.
Tim: how old are you, I would have sid about the same as me in your photo.
Samuel: How old are you, Anna? 
Tim: 55
Samuel: Well there you are you see. I am 35 only. So you are my Anna and I am your Thammadu. 
Tim: Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35:
Samuel: That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, Anna. We work very hard and have very little. But still we are thankful for what we do have."

Chris: When you're not scared to have a plant on your own, to grow yourself a recreational MJ to chill out in the evening...

Macy: wow, thats really cool! well done to her boyfriend!
Helen: There were some other friends there as well, some from Spain, so cool they managed to keep it a surprise!
Macy: did you know any of those other people already?
Helen: Some we had met before, some were new. 
Macy: Is london difficult with a group? We are going with Jeffrey's family soon and I am dreading travelling with a large group...
Helen: This was ok actually as the group kept splitting up in smaller groups, depending on peoples interests. 
Macy: How do you mean?
Helen: Well, we spend as much time as we could with our friends from Spain as we never get to see them, whereas her sister sees her all the time and wanted to do sightseeing in London. But we would then meet up later on again. 
Macy: Nice balance then?
Helen: Yeah it was good. Dinner with more than 10 was difficult though.
Macy: Maybe I should look into reserving a table then?
Helen: I would, especially if you have people with a particular taste or if you need to eat at a certain time. We were mega flexible and ended up eating at 22.30 in a Thai...
Macy: I better reserve a table somewhere then, we have kids with us as well...

Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.
Jennifer: What should I do, Mary?
Mary: First of all, you need to understand the subject matter thoroughly. You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.
Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third‚Ä¶
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters‚Ä¶
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.
Mary: Good. It is easier to convince people and to hold their attention with actual data. It would be even better if you show some pictures along the way. Do you have any?
Jennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.
Mary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.
Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?
Mary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.
Jennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.
Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.
Jennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.
Mary: If you are really prepared, it will be a piece of cake. You will be able to speak with ease and confidence, and you will be amazed by how well you can express yourself.
Jennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.
Mary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.
Jennifer: You are absolutely right. I will take time to practice and to learn to relax and express myself really well. Wish me luck, Mary!
Mary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!"

Lonya: And she went on like this for half an hour or so. Oblivious to her surroundings. She probably didn't even know where she was!
Kitty: And where was she?
Lonya: Tulum temple on the Riviera Maya. Every structure rebuilt for tourists like her. Nothing here is authentic.
Lonya: <file_photo>
Lonya: This side is in its original condition. Can you see what I mean?
Kitty: Yes, I do but would't hold it against them. At least you can see in the reconstruction what these temples looked like. Otherwise you'd be visiting only heaps of rubble.
Kitty: Of course we have in Europe a different attitude to ancient monuments but who knows? Maybe Mexicans are right and not we?
Lonya: I'm not sure. I'll think about it.
Lonya: Maybe what I object most to is the fact that they don't explicitly say it's reconstruction. Seeing my first Maya temple I was in raptures until Thomas showed me those that haven't been reconstructed and explained the idea behind it.
Kitty: Oh stop it Lonya! Just enjoy your holidays and stop philosophizing.

Barrie: Everything's fine at school?
Kev: No pro.
Barrie: You'll tell me everything!
Kev: Sure.
Kev: <file_photo>
Barrie: Yes, I know! Loads of snow and quite cold. Mama sent me pics last night. To prepare us for a shock.
Kev: Why shock? It's winter.
Barrie: You are totally right. Only that we were in a different climate zone and were experiencing different weather conditions.
Kev: You sound like my teacher now.
Kev: Yeah, I know. Palm trees and stuff.
Kev: I'll go with you next year.

Jenny: I should, I know, it would be good for my career
Jeff: no, not so much, I think it's bullshit that it's so important
Simon: is it?
Jeff: sure, the whole net-working thing doesn't really matter, I think
Jeff: nobody offers you a job at a conference
Jeff: and it costs so much to fly to SF
Kim: I would like to go also to see what's going on in the field
Kim: to meet people, see new trends, ideas
Kim: I think it's important for an academic
Jeff: this may be true, if you can afford
Kim: the flight is about ‚Ç¨500, right?
Simon: true
Jeff: and then more money for accommodation
Jeff: it can easily pile up to ‚Ç¨2000
Kim: you're quite right, unfortunately
Jeff: because it also doesn't make sense to fly to California for 3 days
Jeff: it would be also extremely disturbing, with the jet lag etc.
Kim: you're so right :(

Mr. Benson: By the end of the day. 
Andy: Will do. 
Mr. Benson: Thank you, Andy. Mark - you get the hardest task. I want you to do some data mining.
Mark: Data mining? What am I looking for?
Mr. Benson: I want you to pull everything you can find on our clients' financial situation before the agreement with us, one month after signing and their current standing. 
Mark: That's a lot of work. I don't know if that's doable in one day. 
Mr. Benson: I'm sure you can manage.
