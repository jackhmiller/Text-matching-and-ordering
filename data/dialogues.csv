Kit: Coward! :P
Sam: Wait till you find a girlfriend. You'll learn to appreciate peace :P

13728509,"Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!üòç
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!

Lola: Also they never truly accepted me as one of them.
Lola: I was always a ""gringa""
Tom: How long did you live like that?
Lola: About six months
Roberta: So you were selling handcrafts made by you?
Lola: Yes. I made them and sold them
Lola: It wasn't big money though
Lola: Just enough to survive a day
Lola: Pay for bed in a dorm and get something to eat
Lola: In a day I would make maybe 4-5 dollars
Lola: I paid 2 dollars for the bed and the rest was for food
Lola: But there were also days when I couldn't sell anything
Lola: Sometimes I had to sleep on the street
Lola: Often I was hungry 
Tom: That's really impressive, Lola
Tom: Maybe you could write a book about it
Lola: I wrote an article. It should still be somewhere online"

Mari: Asked you? Ordered you to do it, more like! Really Dave, you must stand up to that woman. You boss me around when you feel like it!
Dave: that's true! Anyway, Sharon says her balls are on the line with this campaign if it isn't 100% brilliant!
Mari: her balls! The cheek of the woman! It's you who will get it in the neck if it tanks, love. 
Dave: No, she wouldn't do that!

Dave: Well, I could tell her I want to present the project as I worked on from from the word go. Why should she get all the credit!
Mari: That's the spirit, Dave sweetheart. She's a nasty bully. In fact, I'd have a quiet word with Ian about her. 
Dave: Yeah, he knows all her tricks! Gareth complained to him about her, but he didn't have the stomach for a fight.
Mari: Dave, tell Sharon you're in charge tomorrow and then go and see Ian in his office on Friday.
Dave: Thanks love, I don't know what I'd do without you!
Mari: It's what I'm here for, you big soft idiot!

Tony: I actually agree with him, he was just sincere about this country
Tony: without the common hypocritical buttering up
Jeff: I think it's an orientalisig and patronising article

Taylor: White's Tavern

Al: Oh, I'll dig it out, (if it's there!) and have a read over it next week.
John: Oh shit, I remember Romeo isn't on there, we didn't do it last year, someone's going to have to write up some sheets for it! I'll mention it to Hilary tomorrow in the staff meeting.
Al: Should I offer to do it?
John: Yeah, if you're up for it! It'll earn you some Brownie points with Hilary and Senior staff when it comes to renewing your contract. 
Al: OK, then, I'll tell her tomorrow at the meeting.
John: Good idea, I haven't got your youthful energy!

Keith: hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works?
Keith: then at least you'll know which part needs replacing
Amanda: oh, I could do that, yeah
Amanda: should I get the spare part from apple or...?
Keith: idk, I've never had an iphone. I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... their prices are too high

Keith: can you do it now?

Greg: That's right. We went to Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro
Agnes: That's exactly what I'm planning! :)
Greg: Awesome! That's a good plan
Greg: When are you going?
Agnes: Don't know yet, probably end of june/beginning july. The kids have school till 20th june but maybe we'll go earlier
Agnes: Did you go by car?
Greg: Actually we flew to Zadar, Croatia and rent a car there. Went to Montenegro and stayed in Kotor Bay for a couple of days. Then Bosnia, Croatia again, Slovenia and finally Vienna
Agnes: Wow that sounds amazing!!!
Greg: It was!
Agnes: How long?
Greg: 18days in total
Agnes: We'll have 14-16 days, don't know exactly
Greg: Kotor Bay is a must-see. The beaches are not too impressive but those little old towns are just fabulous. Bosnia is incredibly beautiful, a great place to hike if you have time. 
Agnes: Did you go to Mostar?
Greg: Sure, it's a highlight of course, but Sarajevo is great too. And then in Slovenia we stopped in Maribor.
Agnes: Can you recommend any place to stay in Kotor or Perast?
Greg: We stayed in Herceg novi close to croatian border for 3 days. Then moved to Dobrota, it's between Kotor and Perast but I'm not sure if I can recommend the place. The apartment was a bit dirty.
Agnes: Are there any hotels?
Greg: Not many, it's better to get an apartment, well it depends on your budget of course :)
Agnes: We're going low cost! :) plus two kids plus one dog :)

Jackie: No, but then we leave the lists on the table and forget about them. After some time we cross out the things we've bought 4 one another so that other ppl don't buy the same thing twice ;)
Kim: That's actually pretty sensible. Last Xmas I got 2 identical sweaters and 3 nearly identical hats!
Kris: Hahahaha! At least u didn't get socks!
Adam: What's funny about that?
Kris: Nothing. Just a stereotype that socks are on one hand the most popular present and on the other the least welcome one ;)
Adam: I can vouch 4 that. I get socks every year!
Jackie: Poor thing! Maybe u should do what I do?
Adam: Not a bad idea. How do I convince my family to do the same?
Kim: Just tell them? I'm also fed up with presents that don't suit me.
Jackie: Kim, maybe u should do the same?
Kim: Oh, I will! I'm going to do it 2nite at dinner table! They'll be so surprised!
Adam: I don't think mine will even want to consider it. 
Jackie: Y not? Just tell them how much more fun it is!
Adam: I don't think they'll understand! They think they know what's best 4 me, but have no idea what I like or want.
Kris: Mabe u should talk to them like from ur heart? Tell them that u enjoy their presents, but would like to get something specific this year. Speaking of which, have u got something particular in mind?
Adam: Actually, I do. I've been saving up for this stereo system, but need a little more cash so I thought that my parents could simply kick in a bit. 
Kris: And have u told them?
Adam: No. They wouldn't approve. They already think I list to music too loud.
Jackie: Still, worth a try. If u don't u'll never know. :)
Kim: I know! Come over to my place. I'll tell my parents and u'll know how to talk to yours!
Adam: That's actually not a bad idea. When do u want me over?

Amy: How's Robyn, she feeling more confident?
Leslie: Not really! She's been crying in the ladies toilets most afternoons still.
Amy: Her classes any better behaved?
Leslie: No, definitely not! I was talking to Julian who has the lab next door to her classroom. He said that all the kids in one particular class are trying to get out of the doorway at once, a sort of cork popping out from a bottle scenario!
Amy: Hmm, sounds funny, but there could be safety issues, I'd have a quiet word with Robyn if I were you.
Leslie: I'll try, but she's so sensitive and paranoid. She already thinks I'm picking on her!
Amy: Yes, but we can't allow that kind of thing to carry on, a child could get hurt!
Leslie: OK, I'll gently suggest some strategies. Maybe Julian could nip out and check next Friday last lesson, or at least keep an ear out. I have a cover period then, so if I'm not called, I'll pop over Friday too.
Amy: If she doesn't improve, we'll have to do something official. Keep an eye on her for a few weeks, see how it goes.
Leslie: I don't want to get the senior management team involved yet, just keep it in our dept. I think I'll talk to her to tomorrow.

Katie √¨s fine too, she's learning the clarinet and playing in the Comp's concert in the orchestra so she's a bit nervous. Both looking forward to Christmas, Joshua excited about the elves, he seems fascinated by them. We have the elf on the shelf thing going on, he loves that, Katie plays along too!
Amy: We didn't have that when mine were little, sounds fun! Just the Advent calendar and Christingles and things! Sam was a bit of a pyromaniac so we had to be extra careful with him and candles!

Ella: I've picked up a nasty stomach bug, been in bed for 4 days and slowly recovering.
Frank: Oh poor you! Are you curing yourself or have you consulted a doc?
Ella: I called the pharmacist this morning and learned that the constant pain in my gut and bowel is too much acid and imbalance in the flora.
Frank: Does it mean you've been eating wrong things or what?
Ella: Probably. I'll change my diet today and up the supplements I'm taking.
Frank: And give up on alcohol entirely?
Ella: Oh yes. Regrettably...
Frank: What sort of supps are you taking?
Ella: At the moment only electrolytes.
Frank: You wouldn't go to a proper doc surgery and have your tummy tested?
Ella: Will do if this doesn't pass.
Frank: Be sensible. Diet itself may not be enough. Are you drinking enough liquids?

Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;)
Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;)
Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;)
Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once

Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. 
Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;)
Sally: You're probably right."

Karol: I'm not sure if a 4 year old child can do the puzzles... Isn't that too difficult for such a little creature?
Sylwia: Hahahaha you're being silly!
Sylwia: There're different levels of difficulty, I think you could find some puzzles for even younger 'creatures' :)
Monika: True! Last year I bought jigsaw puzzles for my 3 year old nephew.
Monika: Those were big pieces and the child was doing pretty well with matching them!
Sylwia: You see, Karol? If there was something like that for a 3 year old, you don't have to worry.
Karol: I see...
Monika: Or maybe...
Monika: How much are you planning to spend on this present?
Karol: Like 30 bucks or so
Monika: Because I've got another idea!
Monika: Listen, at the age of 4 children actually start to learn the alphabet in preschool.
Monika: And last time I've been searching for something on eBay, I've come across an auction offering whiteboard with marker pens and plastic letters with magnet.
Monika: The whiteboard's dimensions were 90 cm and 60 cm, if I remember well. Total cost 25 bucks, so it'd fit your budget! :)
Monika: What do you think?
Karol: Wow, the idea is perfect!
Karol: And I could hang the whiteboard on the wall, so it wouldn't require any space on the floor.
Sylwia: I like the idea too. There's always this annoying problem with the kids writing on the wall...
Sylwia: So having that thing on the wall they could be doing it without consequence!

Andy: So basically you got some goodies that you would get anyway by buying it closer to launch date? :P
Lee: Yeah, preorder...

Lee: Although wings not applied yet and I prefer the look of the wings from the original CE.

Martin: That sounds good. What kind of food do you like?
Susan: Oh anything. I am not fussy.
Martin: Maybe Italian?
Susan: Well, I actually have a gluten intolerance so pasta and pizza are both off the menu for me. That makes Italian a bit tricky.
Martin: How about Thai?

Martin: There's a great new Steak House on Station Road, they do really good rib-eye steaks
Susan: We can do that if you want, but I'm actually vegetarian.
Susan: Except for chickens. Chickens are OK
Martin: There's a nice Vegan place doing vegan sushi on London Road. How does that sound?

Jack: What happened???
Jack: Is everything ok??
Mia: Yes, all is good. We got our money back.
Mia: So we got approached by a ""friendly"" stranger on the street who presented himself as a teacher and built our trust by telling family stories.
Mia: Then he recommended us some tourists attractions i.e. The Happy Buddha and some ""excellent"" tailors, where they had the ""last day of promotion"" he stopped a tuktuk for us and verified the driver's license (another trick to build our trust).
Mia: The tuktuk took us to the happy Buddha. 
Mia: When we entered the temple we were approached by a very friendly ""Buddhist prayer"".
Mia: He said that he worked in London for the Thai trade mission.
Mia: He asked us what were our plans for the day and recommended that we went to the tailors showing us a few pictures of clothing that he ""ordered"" there for him and his wife. 
Mia: The tuktuk took us to the tailors were a pushy seller persuaded us to buy some clothes of ""very good quality"". 
Mia: As soon as we paid the tuktuk took us to the next tourist attraction but on the way we read the reviews on Google maps and we realised that we were scammed.
Mia: The reviewers were saying that once they ordered the clothes they were never sent to their country as promised or the finishing was very bad, definitely not worth the money.
Jack: Oh shit!! And you already paid!!!!
Mia: Yeah. We felt horrible!!
Mia: We asked the driver to take us back but he refused. Of course, he already got his commission.
Mia: We ran back to the tailors. Fortunately it wasn't far. Within 10 minutes we were back. We told the pushy seller to cancel our order.
Mia: He said it was impossible because the fabric was already cut to our measurements. 
Mia: When we asked to see the cut fabric it was nowhere to be found, as it was already ""sent to the factory"". 
Mia: Then we said that we were going to call the police.
Mia: Only then he agreed to return us the money.
Jack: What a story!
Jack: I'm glad that you managed to get it back.
Mia: Yeah. It's like 1500 USD!"

James: It is not easy to find an apartment to your liking that does not cost a lot. I 
John: Really? Is it that difficult to find an apartment?
James: No, it is just that everything I like so far is too expensive and way beyond my reach.
John: Is it because they are very close to school? I heard that the closer they are to school, the higher the rental cost.
James: Maybe that is the problem. Since I do not have a car, I need to find something close to school. 
John: Have you thought about sharing an apartment? If you want, we can find a two bedroom apartment and share it. It may be cheaper that way.
James: That could solve our problem.

James: I have to go to work from 8:00AM to 12:00PM, and then I have school from 1:00PM to 5:00PM. After that I plan to go home, eat dinner, and work on my school assignments. How about you?
John: Well, I have class from 8:00AM to 10:00AM, and then I go to the library to work until 2:00PM. After that, it is school again until 4:00PM. I plan to stay on campus until 6:00PM to work on my computer projects, and then go home to work on my other classes‚Äô assignments.
James: It is my turn to ask the second question. Do you plan to have your friends over at the apartment very often?
John: No, not on weekdays. I want to finish my homework during the weekdays as much as possible. I think half of my weekend will also be reserved for homework. If my friends do stop by, it will probably be during the weekend.
James: Good, I plan to do the same things during school time. I also plan to visit my parents during the weekend. My mom is a great cook.
John: My parents‚Äô house is too far to visit once a week. I will go home to see them and my little brother during the holidays. I need to be happy with whatever foods I cook.

Frank: then: ""Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined. Harpier cries, ‚Äú'Tis time, ‚Äôtis time."" - I was thinking something like: ""Really? The hedgehog only whined once! Although this guy Harpier did tell me it was time...""

I also wanted the forked tongue from an adder, maybe lizard‚Äôs leg and an owl‚Äôs wing? That should do the trick! now our potion will truly be horrendous MWAHAHAHA!!!""

Rodney: No, but I'll check it out on Amazon, and maybe download a sample.
Jim: His classes are always fun, and plus you know I like writing, so it's a chance for me to transcribe some of my creativity onto paper. It will definitely spur my songwriting abilities forward.

Tony: And we usually like the same types of games so...

Tony: What do you mean?
Francis: It's not a bad game but it's not for everybody.
Francis: You're not a big fan of negative interaction, right?
Tony: Yeah, sometimes it gets annoying really quickly.
Francis: Well, one of the crucial mechanics in the game is basically negative interaction at its core.
Tony: So I should avoid it?
Francis: That's the tricky part.
Francis: I don't like negative interaction as well but it didn't bother me in this one.
Francis: It's a move you should basically expect from others and it allows you to get your workers back.
Tony: Interesting, how about the rest?
Francis: Can't say anything bad about the components.
Francis: As for artwork you can basically judge that for yourself.
Francis: My main problem with this one is that it lacks focus.
Francis: I think it's best to try it before buying it.
Tony: Did you?
Francis: Yeah, I did and I didn't buy it.
Francis: Doesn't mean it's a bad game but there are other games doing the same things much better.
Tony: Ok, thanks for the info.

Zack: They'll still be no match for Boston. With our amazing manager and the hitters we have, there's no stopping us for the next few years.
Aaron: We'll see about that. Talk to you me in April when the bats start up again :)
Zack: You have to admit, that's some record we put up in the regular season. It was like 108 wins.
Aaron: Yeah, yeah, impressive.
Zack: Maybe you can become a Boston fan :)
Aaron: Never. Congratulations, but I'm as loyal as they get, can't budge me.
Zack: :-/ I tried
Aaron: The victory parade is on Saturday. Make sure to watch.
Zack: I don't think they're going to air it over here. You know, baseball's not very popular here.

John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun!
Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u!
John: That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range.
Brett: What do u mean?
John: If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u. 
Andrew: Sensible. Unlike WoW.
John: So what's WoW like?
Andrew: Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly.
Brett: Not cool. 
John: Yeah. Y would they allow such a thing?
Andrew: Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on.
Brett: Actually, my cousin met his wife there :)
John: Rly?
Brett: Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ;)
Andrew: That's gr8! And how are they getting along now?
Brett: Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;) 
John: Lol
Andrew: Well my favourite genre is RPGs :)
John: Can u name a title, except WoW?
Andrew: I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series :)
Brett: What's this one about?
Andrew: Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times?
John: Well, I haven't.
Andrew: I think I'll have to look for new friends... So embarrassing.
Brett: C'mon! Tell us!

Gabriella: Sorry, I've got to go - I only have 5 more minutes before I'm back to the office.
Pierce: That's okay, I was taking too much time of your lunch break.

Andy: I'm getting very interested in a cruise now x x
Carly: I'll come with you if you want.. you can get the taster ones for 3 or 5 days leave Southampton, the one I went on with Mum had a shopping mall in the centre of the ship.. it was amazing.. x
Andy: Looks great we could have a great laugh togetherüòÇüòÇ  you will have to come with me to show me the ropes x x

Andy: We need a balcony suite for def xx
Carly: Defo, no point in going on a cruse if you cant see the sea from your bed :) 
Andy: Hello you üòäI had a look online last night but it's a bit of a cruise minefield to be honest lol x x
Carly: Yes it is a bit.. there's a 3 day taster to Bruges in Sept 300 ish each from Southampton .. no point in booking for longer unless you know you will like it... you could be green hanging over the side all week lol xxx
Andy: If it sounds like it's a good deal and it's the right accommodation then I think we should book us a little getaway then x x
Carly: Yes definitely be good.. I'll send you details tomorrow xxx
Andy: Send me the dates and I will book the holiday with work
Carly: Ok will do xxx I'm excited xx
Andy: So am I. We are going on a cruise üòäüòäx x
Carly: There is an 80's special for 5 days but it's about 500 and we would probably end up drunk and disorderly
Andy: Well I thought we would end up drunk and disorderly anyway lol. How do you feel about that one or are you wanting just a bit less mayhem üòäx x
Carly: No it would be fab I expect I'll find out more and see how much I  can afford lol xx How about Southampton to Bruges back to Southampton on 5th Oct for 3 nights.. 366pp.. balcony suite..
Andy: Sounds good, I'll come over this weekend and we can look together xx

Tom: why? quite a strange change
Sam: I don't need all the fancy options of it, I'm not an IT worker, I don't make animations nor I compose music
Sam: So most of the powerful stuff inside it remains unused
Sam: it's wasteful
Tom: So what do you use your laptop for?
Sam: I'm writing my PhD dissertation on it, I have quite many pictures, but that's all
Zoe: hmm, it seems to me that what you need is a light computer with a good battery (that can keep up to 12 hours) and a lot of memory
Sam: that would be perfect
Zoe: ok, so in this case changing to a MacBook Air wouldn't be a bad idea
Sam: exactly, that's what I thought, I don't need an expensive computer that has some amazing abilities that I'll never use
Zoe: ok, get yourself one then, there is a new version of it
Zoe: I think they launched it in November
Sam: ok!
Zoe: and if you want to buy it in the US, remember that there are a few states that don't have the sales tax
Sam: which states?
Zoe: I think on the East coast it's Delaware and New Hampshire, but google it

Martin: Calm down, there are millions of women in this situation all the time, it's manageable.

Kate: Five gallons, how much is that in litres?
Surinder: You don't have gallons in England?
Kate: Not any more. Anyone over sixty knows what they are.
Kate: We didn't learn about them in school. I know a pint is a beer glass, but how many pints are in a litre I can't remember, ten?
Surinder: Eight.
Kate: OK, well we have everything in decimal, so.
Surinder: It's about 25 litres, a foot by a foot by a foot.
Kate: Well, quite frankly I wouldn't keep any goldfish in such a small tank. Not for more than a day or so, if I had to. 
Surinder: Too small? But they are selling them for goldfish in the shop
Kate: I know about that. Still no serious fishkeeper with do this. 
Surinder: I don't want to be cruel
Kate: It isn't only about that, it is just not viable as an aquarium. You can't fit a filter or a light on there. 
Surinder: So which tak should I buy?
Kate: Get the biggest tank that you have space for, but remember they are very heavy, so only put them on strong, flat topped furniture. Then get the biggest tank you can find a good place for. 
Surinder: Then I can have more than one goldfish, right?
Kate: Yes, and that's a good idea because they like to be in company with others of their own species
Surinder: And maybe other kinds too?
Kate: Which kind of goldfish do you have?
Surinder: It is actually white with a red blob on its head.
Kate: Red cap oranda. They are supposed to represent the flag of Japan. 
Surinder: Nice! I didn't know that.
Kate: Yes. But anyway, fancy goldfish should only be kept with other fancy goldfish.
Surinder: Thanks for the info. I will get a bigger tank today."

Hettie: Dear Peggie, how sweet of you to remember! Thank you very much.
Peggie: I thought I'd contact you today rather than on your birthday proper so that I don't interrupt any celebrations. Time difference and so on.How are you doing?
Hettie: Certainly you wouldn't interrupt anything. The only celebration planned for tomorrow is an evening meal with my son and his wife. And with Thomas of course.
Hettie: Thank you. We are fine. Just the usual routine, nothing special happening. And how are you? Must be ages since we were in touch last!
Peggie: Nothing of importance happens in a life of an old woman! Apart from occasional ailments and similar discomforts. Thank goodness I'm fine.
Peggie: Laura, my daughter, gave birth to twins in March, two lovely girls, and my son Simon has moved house to Derry. A bit too far for me to drive to see them but I understand it's been necessary for his career. They say I should also move closer to them but I'm not ready to sell my house yet. As long as I feel fit to look after it, I'll stay here. So that's my news.
Peggie: Would you remember old Mr Lars, my next door neighbour? Well, he passed away two months ago. A stroke, I heard. Such a nice person! And not that old at all. 86 or something.
Hettie: Congratulations and best wishes to Laura! So how many children have they got now? I've somehow lost count.
Hettie: Yes, I remember him. So sorry to hear about his death.
Peggie: With the twins four. It's Simon whose family keeps on growing. They have got five children and Adela, Simon's wife, says she'd like to have a baby again. Well... They can surely afford it so why not? They are a very harmonious family.
Hettie: I can understand that you don't want to leave the house you've spent most of your life in. It's such a beautiful house too.
Hettie: By the way, we will probably be moving house soon too. A real estate agent, in fact a good friend of ours, has found an old farmhouse in need of a major overhaul in the area close to the Grampians. I have always wanted to live there! What's more, Thomas will be able to continue his research work in the National Park. We are both quite thrilled and hope it will happen.
Peggie: Why shouldn't it, if I may ask?
Hettie: Sorry to be so confused about all these kids!
Hettie: It's a question of funds, very banal.
Peggie: I'm sure you can sort it out. Anyway I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
Hettie: Thanks Peggie. And thank you for the birthday wishes! Always nice to chat with you - across the ocean.
Peggie: My pleasure. Aren't these electronic and digital gadgets wonderful? I'm so proud I've mastered the basic use of my smartphone. Very useful!
Peggie: So all the best to you and please give my regards to Thomas.
Hettie: Thanks a lot. Love!"

Jenny: It sure is. What would you like to know?
James: I'm interested in applying for Junior Project Manager position and I wonder what my chances are.
Jenny: Ok, may you send me your CV? It may be easier that way :)
James: Of course, thanks!
James: <file_other>
Jenny: Hm, ok. First of all, I'd change the format and the layout. I think it's better to send your CV in pdf rather than doc.
James: Ok
Jenny: As for the layout, you have some cool experience and I think the way its presented doesn't give you justice. Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.
James: Cool, never thought about it!
Jenny: It seems like you are a down-to-earth guy which is probably good for a project manager, but at Netflix we highly value the creative side of people :)
James: Thank you so much Jenny! Will work on it.
Jenny: <file_other>
Jenny: Here you'll find some cool templates you can get your inspiration from.
James: Thanks! I was also wondering about the atmosphere at the office. To put it bluntly, do you like your job? :)
Jenny: Oh yes! A lot! Keep in mind that I'm in the marketing team, so slightly different story.
Jenny: But yeah, I think it's a cool place to work at. My team is absolutely brilliant, people are motivated, inspiring, so I really couldn't ask for more.
James: Do you know then anyone from the business team? It almost sounds to good to be true :)
Jenny: I know a few, they're a nice bunch as well :) There are some ups and downs as everywhere, some things that could be improved, so it's not perfect, but still good.
Jenny: Also, don't forget it IS a corporation and a big one on top of that :D
James: Yeah, that's why I'm so curious about the atmosphere, etc. I've only worked in small companies.
Jenny: So what made you change your mind?
James: I think it's time to try something different :)
Jenny: It definitely is! I think if you have an open mind, like to learn and work under pressure, you may like it. Fingers crossed!
James: Thanks! May I have a couple of more questions?

Agnes: Cool :) Here are some gift inspirations, let me know what you think: <file_other>
Agnes: <file_photo>
Jane: This first one is so sweet! OMG baby clothes are terrific!
Alice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won‚Äôt use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.
Agnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won‚Äôt even remember who she got them from.
Alice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.
Kathy: Guys, how about some compromise? Both ideas are great so maybe we can buy a cheaper onesie, e.g. <file_other> and put it in a basket surrounded by diapers? Look: <file_photo>
Jane: Now that‚Äôs something worth considering.
Alice: Win-win
Agnes: I still think clothes are better, but we live in a world of democracy, so I won‚Äôt argue.
Kathy: Don‚Äôt be like this, Agnes‚Ä¶
Agnes: Like what?
Alice: A bitch?
Agnes: EXCUSE ME? Did you just call me a B WORD?!?!?!?!

Tom: What should I visit there?
Peter: Go to Cracow and Warsaw, there are very different, then if you have some more time go to see other places
Tom: I would like to see some nature, I'm not into cities
Peter: So go to this lake region in the North-East and there is also this famous UNESCO primordial forest at the border with Belarus, but the name of it is unpronounceable.
Tom: Cool, I'll google it, any small villages?
Peter: Some Polish friends told me that it's worth to go to the mountains in the South-East, they are quite popular there, it's a remote and peaceful place I think.
Tom: Have you travelled around a lot?
Peter: Not really, I stayed in the cities, since I worked all the time. I visited Gdansk and Wroclaw and Poznan.
Tom: I would like to explore Eastern Europe a bit, but it's wild side, like Carpathians, forests, remote beaches.
Peter: It's such a great idea! You should go to the Baltic states, I really like Latvia.
Tom: Why?
Peter: A beautiful coast with amazing sunsets, since it's the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. Riga is a very cute town, and they have amazing forests as well and little towns.

13729117,"Andy: I am looking for a sofabed
Phuti: Certainly sir, we have many different sofabeds in store.
Andy: Do you have any which are just under 150cm wide?
Phuti: Yes, one model is 144 cm wide and uses that space very well, no wastage of space with unnecessary ornamentation. The mattress is really broad enough for two people. It is the ""Monica 144"" model
Andy: What colours is it available in?
Phuti: We have black and beige only. There is blue, red and grey but you would have to order them, sir.
Andy: Beige sounds very good for this room. Can I collect it?
Phuti: Yes, just come in any time, but you will need a big vehicle, you won't get this inside of an ordinary car.
Andy: I have a Chrysler Grand Voyager
Phuti: The one where all the seats tuck in flat?
Andy: That's the one. 
Phuti: That is an excellent car, sir.
Andy: It is very functional and practical. I just have the problem that I cannot find a good mechanic for it.
Phuti: You should try maybe the workshop owned by the husband of my wife's boss. He is said to be the best mechanic in the country.
Andy: Really? What is his name?
Phuti: His name is Mr J L B Matekone. 
Andy: I think I have heard of him, his workshop is called Speedy Motors, or something like that?
Phuti: Yes, Sir. Out on the Tlokweng Road. You should definitely give him a try.
Andy: I will. And I will come in later for the sofa
Phuti: I'll put it aside for you, sir."

Natty: Have 2 download it! 
Vic:  Try it ;) It's almost the same as the original :)
Natty: Almost?
Vic: Well, they can't make it identical, 'cause they'll get sued, right?
Natty: Right. But still building castles, running around, doing quests?
Vic: Absolutely :) the downside is that it's a freemium :(
Natty: What's freemium?
Vic: Do u pay 4 ur games?
Natty: No. 
Vic: Do u have ads in them?
Natty: Yeah. Unless I turn off wi-fi ;)

Vic: Good for u ;) any game u can recommend?
Natty: Except Air Combat Pilot? :)
Vic: U know what? I'll give it a go. Ur downloading War and Magic and I'll download that.

13828271,"Diana: Hi Chris! Karen told me that you know someone from AIESEC
Chris: Hello Diana! Good to hear from you!
Chris: Not only I know someone from AIESEC, but I'm working with them myself :) How can I help you? Are interested in one of the projects?
Diana: Great! Thanks for replying so quickly :)
Diana: I was browsing your website and looking for different opportunities. I am particularly interested in Asia and Northern America, my only problem is that I don't speak other language than English
Chris: Ok, it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be eligible to participate in projects in other countries. Especially in Asia we have a lot of opportunities for people who would like to teach English
Diana: That's great news! Won't it be a problem that I'm not a teacher? I don't have any experience
Chris: It all depends on what you would like to do, are you interested in being a volunteer or in something paid?
Diana: I'm interested in travelling that's for sure, so I really want to go somewhere. If you have something that will allow me to get paid for my work and will be in line with my experience, that'd be absolutely wonderful.
Diana: I'm open for being a volunteer as well - the only problem's that I may not be able to afford to pay for the accommodation.
Chris: Most of the organisations we're cooperating with cover the cost of the accommodation of our volunteers. You usually pay for a plane ticket and food. Certain organisations offer pocket money
Diana: Yes, I saw one really interesting offer from Japan. They're looking for someone who could teach English in high school, although they listed some nationalities - didn't mention British, quite surprising in my opinion. Does it mean that I can't apply?
Chris: Could you please send me a link? We have a lot offers and it'd be easier for me to advice you if I know the offer
Diana: Sure <file_other>
Chris: Thanks!
Chris: Okay, so, I think in this case it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. You may not be regarded as a preferred candidate, but I don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre not eligible. Also, if you‚Äôre really interested, I‚Äôll gladly contact the organisers and ask if they are interested in your profile.
Diana: That would be amazing! Thank you Chris!
Chris: If this one doesn‚Äôt work out, and please, be aware that we‚Äôre in touch with people all over the world so it may happen that you won‚Äôt get the job you applied for, are you interested in another position?
Diana: I think I‚Äôll be happy to participate in any project in Japan (as a volunteer or not), unless it‚Äôs related to computers, IT, technology, etc. as I have absolutely no clue about that stuff
Chris: And what about North America? You mentioned that you may be interested in this as well
Diana: Yes, I think it‚Äôs pretty much the same as with Japan. I‚Äôm not too keen on being a teacher at a camp, but everything other than that would be great
Chris: Got it! I will look for something suitable. May you send me your CV?
Diana: <file_other>
Chris: Thanks! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask :)
Diana: Thank you! I really appreciate your help Chris. The whole idea is brilliant, but I admit it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming and confusing especially as you‚Äôre new to the whole thing
Chris: No worries, I've heard that a lot and we're doing everything we can to facilitate the process and make it more user friendly
Chris: We also highly recommend everyone to visit us in one of our offices, so if you live in London, I'll be happy to meet you

13715824,"Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;)
Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
Vic: Me neither. 
Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)

Simon: BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly
Charlie: This photo is great. It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy. 
Charlie: Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city.
Charlie: Poland though...
Charlie: One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism
Charlie: The question is - for how long...
Simon: I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation
Simon: I mean being economically delayed for few decades
Simon: Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made.
Simon: The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. 
Charlie: Yup. And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation.
Simon: I admire Poles.
Simon: I admire them for they will to fight.
Simon: They never give up.
Charlie: Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map.
Simon: I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe.
Charlie: Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart.
Simon: Let's hope not.
Charlie: Yup. To conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe :D

Matt: TWITTER
Alex: Hmm that's an entire new dimension to explore
Matt: Without a doubt, this has brought 3D into my life. A considerable improvement
Alex: Man, what's happening to you, you're jokes aren't even funny anymore
Matt: There you go, the aftereffects of 3D
Alex: So what are you actually doing?
Matt: Well actually/to be fair/quite frankly unpaid job number 5 is not that bad at all. I'm working for this association which organises a few events during the year and I'm the Secretary, which looks cool on the cv. And has made me learn what twitter actually is. Before I only knew it from the news, because of Trump lol
Alex: ha ha ha! And What are you promoting atm?
Matt: I'm going to casually mention that we're having an event at the British Library and that's what I'm promoting
Alex: wow sounds really good
Matt: Yer, good opportunity for networking and I work with really nice people too
Alex: That's cool
Matt: I think it could hardly be better actually. It's also true that these professional British people can sometimes be extremely unprofessional, but this might be the most entertaining part of the job to be fair. The other day, for instance, my colleagues sent me a promo leaflet which repeatedly mentioned the British Museum and I immediately circulated it through all our social media, mailing list, etc. Turned out it was supposed to be the British Library. Can you dig it?
Alex: Ahahahaha that's hilarious!! I'm speechless
Matt: Well, so am I. Really glad that it's not a paid job actually

13682539-1,"Sandeep: Sir, there are two monkeys loose in the factory. So far they have damaged the ceiling in four rooms. We would like to call an extermination service before they do more damage. Please advise.
Santakumar: This is terrible. Have the guards not been called?
Sandeep: Sir, yes, the guards have not been able to chase them out.
Santakumar: What have they tried?
Sandeep: They have tried getting them with food and tried setting off the fire alarm to scare them. Nothing has worked.
Santakumar: There must be something else we can do. Are the bay doors open?
Sandeep: The bay doors are left open for them to run out, but they are hiding in the ceiling.
Santakumar: Do we know where they are now?
Sandeep: Not really until they make a noise. We think they are in the Engineering offices.
Santakumar: Make sure they stay out of the test lab!
Sandeep: That is the fear. That they will damage valuable equipment.
Santakumar: How did they get in?
Sandeep: It is not known, but perhaps on a truck.
Santakumar: Well, if you have to call, do it today. Let me know the cost. 
Sandeep: I will do it now.
Santakumar: And I don't want them hurt or killed. They must be safely relocated.
Sandeep: Certainly.
Santakumar: That's all we need is animal cruelty on our heads.
Sandeep: Seems cruel to keep them shut in a factory too but they aren't smart enough to leave.
Santakumar: Make sure there is no food anywhere for them to get into.
Sandeep: It will be done.
Santakumar: Thank you."
13728245,"Vera: Do you know any games that would work well during a get-together party?
Olga: That's an interesting question
Olga: Actually, I remember one we used to play in college
Olga: It's called 'Mafia'
Vera: Sounds intriguing :) Can you describe how it works more less, please?
Vera: I invited some colleagues from my new job and hope to spend this time in a relaxed atmosphere
Olga: Sure, I'll try
Olga: So... It all comes down to playing various roles
Olga: You need to prepare little notes with the following roles written on them: 'mafia' (2 or 3 such notes), 'mayor', 'policeman' and the rest will be 'residents'
Olga: Everyone picks a random note
Olga: The game is led by a preselected person, let's call him a leader. There are 2 parts of the game - night and day
Olga: All the players sleep at night, I mean everyone closes their eyes
Olga: The leader says which character should wake up. Mafia wakes up every night and eliminates one player
Olga: The next one to wake up is mayor who can save a chosen player from death, including himself
Olga: Then a policeman wakes up and have an option of checking up on a chosen player by asking the leader if that person is a mafia member
Olga: Remember that nobody says anything - you make gestures to communicate 
Olga: Are you with me, Vera? :D
Vera: Sure, ofc, it shapes up well! Keep going, please :)
Olga: Sweet :)
Olga: So... The night ends and it's daytime now. A person indicated (killed) by mafia is out of the game and the players discuss who can be a perp
Olga: This is the most important element of the game because here the fun begins. The city seek to eliminate mafia and the mafia's trying to kill the mayor or the residents
Olga: And now the last thing that I should mention - the worst mistake while playing the game is to hurry.
Olga: You need to have plenty of time for Mafia. And trust me, it's addictive ;)
Vera: Wow, Olga, this all sounds fantastic!!
Vera: I'm sure everybody will like it
Vera: How about you? That would be just awesome if you could join us :)
Olga: Hmm... When are you planning to meet?
Vera: Friday evening :)
Olga: Actually, why not. I'll be your tutor :)
Vera: Super!"

Helen: Did Oliver get one of those award things yesterday?
Stacey: I don't think so, what are they?
Helen: Im not sure, I think they are called attendance awards or something
Stacey: oh yeah, Lindsay mentioned those, they are for kids who had 100% attendance this term. 
Stacey: Oliver didn't get one cause he has had a chest infection a little while back. 
Stacey: Has Kelsey not got one?
Helen: No she didn't, she has been poorly for a few days though. So the kids get awards if they haven't been sick?
Stacey: I guess so, sounds strange doesn't it?
Helen: I think so, they can't help it can they. School even tells us to keep them home when they are unwell. 
Helen: not very nice if you miss out on an award just because you have been ill 
Stacey: I guess they are trying to get attendance levels up by rewarding kids with awards
Helen: surely you'd want to address that with the parents though? Now you make the kid responsible for something they cant influence! 
Stacey: yeah and now the problem kids feel even more of a failure by not getting an award!
Helen: I don't think I like this very much, shall we have a word with the teacher? 
Stacey: I think you might have to go to the head straight away. Doesn't sound like something Mrs Bell has come up with...
Helen: Cool Are you coming?
Stacey: Sure. Let's check with Linds as well, she might wanna come.
Helen: yeah cool, see you tomorrow

Kitty: You know what? I've just come up with another idea to continue. And I can include yours to it. Brilliant! Thanks a lot!!! :D
Victoria: Haha, you're welcome! :D I can't wait to read it. xx Let me know when it's finished? xx
Kitty: Shall do! :D It might take me a while to sort out the details though, but all will come in good time :)
Kitty: Out of curiosity, did you add my story to the community ""The Best, funny and Romantic fanfiction""?
Victoria: Haha, no I didn't. :L Congratulations! :) xx
Kitty: You didn't?! Then who did? I guess I'll never know. Thanks, by the way. :)
Victoria: It's a mystery. o.O And you're welcome. :)
Kitty: Oh, I read some of your stories - not bad! I like 'Housemates' and 'The Vagabond Opera' (found them interesting) :)
Kitty: Also, because I'm in a promoting mood, I figured you might like my other story: ""Don't you dare!"" That is, if you want to read it :)
Victoria: Oh noees, I hate those fics. D: I'm currently trying to co-author with a friend, but it's her birthday today, so we haven't got much done. :P Still, it's a lot better than the crappy fanfiction I've got up here at the moment. xx
Victoria: I'll give it a read right now. :) xx
Kitty: Ooo - What are you writing about?? Miraculous ladybug figs or something else?? Good luck with the writing! :) And enjoy! :P

Victoria: Sure. :) We're aiming for 50,000 words, and so far I've got 5,000 words down, so the first chapter should be posted very soon. xx 
Kitty: Is this with the Marauders?? Or am I wrong?? Well done at getting 5000 - that's quite an achievement!! xx
Victoria: Thanks :) The most words I've written for a story is 9000, so I'm pretty concerned. D: No, it's Harry travelling back in time. We wanted to write something with lots of hippies and stuff. XD There's the Marauders in it, though. So far I've just been writing the prologue and stuff. xx
Kitty: Ah okay. Does Harry meet his parents or should I just wait and see? ;) 9000 compared to my short capters (them most I've ever written was 859 words) is a lot - at least to me :) xx
Victoria: Haha, yes he does. ;) I'm not good with sticking with things, so I just tend ot give up halfway through. :P I love your short stories, they're so good.
Victoria: But my co-author is killing me! So far, she has done a spectactular zero words. I'm busting my ** off over here, and I've a ton of History exams and crap to prepare for. She's just had her birthday, so I can't really complain, but I've nearly got 7000 words now and my brain seriously hurts. D:

Sarah: yeah but it is a lot of work as well
Adrian: we can always use catering

Sarah: that's not a bad idea but we still need to make a list of what we want
Adrian: you can't go wrong with some meat based dished
Adrian: something with chicken, salads, stuff like that
Adrian: we can't forget that Glen and Marty are both vegetarian so we need something they can eat as well
Sarah: true, maybe we should check the options that they have available and choose based on that?
Adrian: not a bad idea
Adrian: otherwise we would invent dishes that they don't have in their offer
Sarah: can you look for the available options?
Sarah: or should I do it by myself?
Adrian: leave it to me
Adrian: that shouldn't be a problem

Stewart: I can't wait to vote for anyone else but him.
Shari: I know what you mean. Half my friends voted for him just to see what would happen! Well, guess what?
Stewart: Yeah, but we couldn't go another 4 years with a Democrat. The country would go broke!
Shari: Maybe, but at least we wouldn't be hated around the world and led by an ignorant piece of shit!

Karolina: Are you serious?
Jack: Maybe. I still have to confirm some details, but my older sister goes to Stanford as well and she was saying that one of her roomates was going to leave and her and their other roomate were panicking about how they were going to pay the rent. Maybe it could work.
Karolina: Oh my God, If that's a possibility I'll be forever thankful.
Jack: Let me just check with my sister. Or better yet, I'll give you her number and  you can talk to her directly. I'm sure she knows way more about this than i do.

Pat: Yeah, just think about FFVII.
Jack: Well, yes, kind of... Final Fantasy VII was a great game back in 1996 but, you know, it's aged terribly... the graphics, I mean.
Pat: But the story is still incredible! And the gameplay and overall experience...
Drew: Yeah, if one ignores all those annoying random combat encounters!
Pat: You're nitpicking.

Pat: Bit personal, dear! No, we retired from the pub 10 years ago, mid-60s, me and Jon have had a ball, cruises, safaris and I've seen my sister in Oz and my brother in Thailand several times.
Sandra: Oh Pat, that sounds lovely! My husband's still working, but we're planning a special trip to the US in a year or two. Can't wait! He's 66, and has had enough!
Pat: So, apart from Bren, you found any others?
Sandra: There was Betty Davies, but she was about 60 when the factory closed in 94, long time ago, if she's alive, I don't suppose she's on Facebook at 84 or something!
Pat: No, I suppose not, but you never know! I heard Marigold had passed away, you know, the supervisor?
Sandra: Yes, very sad, not long after Lister's closed, I think.
Pat: Ok, what about that young girl who loved David Bowie, joined us in about 73, only about 16 she was, I think. She always tried to match his current look, you remember when she did Ziggy Stardust with ginger hair and no eyebrows!
Sandra: Oh yes, Amanda Johnson, she was even younger than me and Brenda! She's still over 60 now though! She may well be on Facebook, did she get married, do you remember?
Pat: Not sure, could be tricky tracking all these down, so many common names!
Sandra: Oh yes, Magda Zielinski was in our section too! Maybe an easier name to find. Her mum was Polish, I think.
Pat: Oh yes, Magda, what a beauty! She was like one of the girls from Charlie's Angels, the blonde one.
Sandra: Yes, Farrah Fawcett, with the lovely hairstyle! I think Magda should have been a model, not a machinist!
Pat: Well, Sand, lovely to hear from you, please keep in touch about the reunion, or just for a chat! Bye!
Sandra: OK, Pat, hope to see you again, bye!"

Mag: nice!
Tom: Yes, but people were not convinced that it makes sense at all, they believe the first one is still binding 
Mag: Sure, we may hate it, but we should accept the democratic decision
Tom: sure, but for this reason we should have another referendum
Mag: hmm, generally I agree, it just doesn't seem to be a possible option
Tom: If people demanded it, they would have to respond somehow
Mag: Maybe we could have a referendum about the deal May got in Brussels 
Tom: I think that's the best opportunity
Mag: Especially that so many people are disappointed with the deal
Tom: which is the most ridiculous! What did they think? That we would have all benefits of the membership and all benefits of being outside?

13680505,"Samantha: Hi Soph, how about some more apples? We've got tons!!! Would you like another batch?
Soph: Hello Samantha, in fact I might. They ARE so tasty. But not too much please.
Samantha: There's no such thing as too much apples :))
Soph: One basket or two will be enough!
Samantha: Great! I'll get you a small basketful of cooking apples and a bigger one with different sorts of dessert apples. So happy they'll be put to good use:)
Soph: That sounds a lot! Thank you. I can always share them with my neighbor.
Samantha: I really don't know what to do with them all! We're eating them with everything really and I've made some apple puree and some apple chutney. But what else?
Soph: How about apple juice?
Samantha: But then I'd have to have it pressed. Professionally I mean. Can you have it done somewhere?
Soph: I think last year Oli and Natt took their whole apple harvest to some organic fruiter who's got a processing unit. And in exchange they received an adequate amount of juice.
Samantha: So it wasn't juice from their own apples?
Soph: As I understood it, no. But doesn't matter since it was an organic grower. And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.
Samantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.
Soph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you! Here's his number 07634 235 987 32.
Samantha: Ta, I'll contact him. Mike's thinking about buying a proper juice maker but I don't fancy all that work. Washing, pressing, bottling, pasteurising... No!
Soph: It's probably not worth it. Better to have it done professionally.
Samantha: My point exactly. Is it ok if I get you the apples tomorrow morning?
Soph: Nobody's home then but you can leave them on the terrace in the back.
Soph: I still have your apple basket. The one Mike'd bought apples last week. I'll put it on the terrace for you.
Samantha: So you've got it!  I thought I was missing one. It's alright, I still have more than enough of them :)
Soph: Very well then. And thanks for the apples.
Soph: And the delivery :))
Samantha: Pleasure."
13828286,"Ash: Thanks so much! I am feeling so much better. I'm gonna work on the next chapter as soon as I can. I'm hoping to actually work on it tonight, but I have to beta another story. Thanks again!!!
Mollie: Please do! I love all your stories but this one cuts the cake. :) I'm glad to hear you're feeling better :D and have fun Beta-ing! :P
Mollie: P.S. Can I ask dor a small-ish favour? Could you make Clara say (in that last chapter): ""run you clever boy"" or something like that? If not I get it :P
Ash: I'm not sure if I can in the last chapter, BUT I was thinking about it...I might be able to make another itty bitty cameo with he...and I might be able to have her say it... I gotta think about how to incorporate it! 
Mollie: There is an option to edit chapters - it's really weird but manageable. Wither way, having Clara back would be exciting :D
Ash: Yeah... I know how to do that. I just wasn't sure if it made sense for her to say ""clever boy."" But I'm gonna try to have her pop back in. Maybe in the last chapter. Want to make such a lovely reviewer happy :)
Ash: Maybe this will make up for it until we get there? 
Ash: <file_other>
Mollie: Hey!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-
Mollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D
Mollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P
Ash: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;) 
Mollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??
Mollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D
Ash: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.
Mollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*
Mollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P
Mollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P 
Ash: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the ""original"" is somewhere.
Ash: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help? 
Mollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author"" :P
Mollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense? Think of it as me creating a fanfic in my head of an actual fanfic :P"

Tonia: All the very best to you, dear Carol and Charles, in 2019!
Carol: Thank you my Dear :* :*
Carol: How are you? Enjoying Cuba?
Tonia: The country is a bit tough. Very poor, hard living conditions. So the stay here is a bit too long for my liking.
Carol: And what does Mark say? He'd been to Cuba before, hadn't he?
Tonia: Yes, some 20 years ago! No comparison. He says it's much worse now. But he seems to enjoy every moment of our stay. Maybe with the exception of loud music all the time.
Carol: Do they party every night?! Is it live music?
Tonia: Everything! In Cuba nobody cares about such nonsense as night rest of the neighbours. It is noisy, and I mean NOISY, at all hours. People, cars, children, music, dogs...
Carol: That sounds exactly like our black folk here!!
Carol: It must be difficult when you plan your trips to predict a perfect length of a stay in one place. Which town was so bad?
Tonia: Havana Vieja. Add to the noise a narrow street, windows that can't be closed and the proximity to a major thoroughfare.
Carol: I got it! Like in a township.
Tonia: Are they so noisy? Can't remember really. Or, truth to tell, was never in any of them but only driving thru.
Carol: My domestic helper, who is black and obviously lives in a township, is always complaining that she can't sleep from the partying in her neighbourhood.
Tonia: When it gets bad, I take my earplugs and Mark another drink ;-)) Nothing more one can do!
Tonia: How is Charles? Is his operation in a week's time or so?
Carol: He's doing well, thank you. It's on the 23rd and he's not looking forward to it. But we are coping!
Tonia: Poor Charlie! Is he afraid of pain? Or of the complete anesthetics? Or complications?
Carol: A combination of them all, I guess. But he doesn't talk much about it and I don't insist.
Tonia: Right. Mark will be getting his op in mid February. Too early to even start being apprehensive.
Carol: You two just enjoy your holidays and make the most of it!
Tonia: Sure! After all it is Caribbean!

13731158,"Simon: What's the dumbest proverb you can think of?
Alan: I don't know. Laughter is the best medicine?
Simon: Yeah, that's a good one. It's not exactly going to do much against bubonic plage is it?
Alan: Not really. Doctor, I have these swellings under my armpit! That's alright I'll tell you a joke.
Simon: Any more?
Alan: A stitch in time saves nine. I don't understand how you can stitch time in the first place, and why it should save nine instead of seven or eleven, for example.
Simon: That was the original title of the Outlander novel, you know?
Alan: What ""A Stitch in Time saves Nine?""
Simon: No, just ""A stitch in time"". That was what Diana Gabaldon called it. Later on they changed the further issues of Book one to Outlander and called it the Outlander series and the TV shows were always just called Outlander.
Alan: About the best historical drama ever made, in my opinion. Really insightful about the eighteenth century. You can almosot feel as if you have lived in it.
Simon: I agree. The only better series I know is Breaking Bad, but that's a completely different genre.
Alan: Both BB and Outlander are hard to cast when it comes to genre. I would say they transcend genre. But you are right, they are very different. 
Simon: which do you like better?
Alan: I would still say that BB is the single best TV series ever made, and that by a wide margin. However, once you have seen it from beginning to end and you know what is coming, you don't want to watch it again.
Simon: Right. Whereas you can watch all the Outlander series several times just for the historical insight and the atmosphere as well as the artistic beauty of the scenes and cinematography.
Alan: Yes and Catriona Balfe
Simon: Indeed. There's nobody on Breaking Bad who quite equals her, is there?
Alan: I quite liked Marie Schrader and Jessie's girlfriend who chokes on her own vomit, but Skyler is not exactly my type:
Simon: No. And anyway none of them can hold a candle to Catriona. 
Alan: She's a gorgeous woman and a fantastic actress.  
Simon: She and Sam really bring the books to life."

Quentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.
Tarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? 
Quentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm
Tarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. 
Quentin: Great.
Tarquin: How many books do you think there will be?
Quentin: About 200, like the other time.
Tarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? 
Quentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.
Tarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. 
Quentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.
Tarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?
Quentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.
Tarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?
Quentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.
Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.
Quentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.
Tarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?
Quentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special ""Quentin price"" only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise."

July: some stuff to drink: coffee, tea

July: some dried tomatoes and feta cheese, i can make a decent salad for the barbecue

Mary: Oh my gosh! So you are travelling again. What is it like there? How long are you staying there?
Carol: Yes, Will insisted on a couple of months in the tropics before his hip operation, so we decided to go full bore and try again something rougher. So far everything's been going smoothly.
Mary: Isn't Mexico a bit dangerous? Have they got good medical care, just in case?
Carol: We are in Yucatan only, which is pretty touristy and they put great store on safety as tourism's their major source of income. As for their medical services I do hope we won't have to try them out. Besides we both have  our foreign travel insurances with a guarantee of immediate transport to Europe, if need be. Fingers crossed!
Mary: Good! And you are extra careful too, I hope.
Carol: But of course! We've rented a car to be independent of their erratic public transport and they seem to have a good network of fairly good roads. Mostly empty, sometimes even overgrown by vegetation on the sides.We never travel after dark of course.
Carol: <file_photo>
Mary: Good Lord! It looks like a narrow tunnel through a dense jungle! Any big animals?
Carol: They seem never to clear the sides of the roads, so the verges are kept clear of vegetation only on busy roads with much traffic. But most of their roads are like this, no one in sight for miles.
Carol: <file_photo>
Mary: Would suit my driving!
Carol: It soon becomes deadly boring. We tried to keep ourselves entertained by keeping the radio on and picking up as much Spanish as possible but it turned even a greater bore! 8D Anyway we're not overdoing it with driving. So much to see around!
Mary: Mayan monuments?
Carol: Caught you here! Had made the same mistake myself. We've been instructed to say ""Maya monuments""  as the adjective Mayan refers mostly to people and their languages.
Mary: Ooops! Once a teacher, always a teacher.
Carol: :‚ÄëP No pro! Anyway we've been visiting all sorts of Maya monuments, mostly temples, but I still know precious little about them. Our guidebooks are worthless, only this touristy crap.
Mary: Oh don't be so critical about them. They are destined for different readership. You'll catch up when back home.
Carol: I hope I will! But with Will's operation looming over us, I might find it difficult. The thought about it seems to be bogging us down even here, but we avoid talking about it.
Mary: Oh Carol! Stop worrying! It is a standard operational procedure, one of the most common surgeries. William is fit and has no known ailments that usually beset men of his age. It's going to proceed without any complications. Take my word for it!
Carol: Thank you, Mary. I surely trust your opinion, after all you are a doctor. But you know what it's like.
Mary: Of course I do and I do understand you are upset. But please don't. Just enjoy your holidays!
Carol: You are right. We'll make the most of them.

Katherine: I need to update my security info, and I'm not able too
Katherine: <file_photo>
Katherine: That's the message
Katherine: No idea why its like this, it's prompting me to send a code to that email, with no other choice
Pabulo: Hmm..
Pabulo: That appears to be the email used when registering
Pabulo: Have you already made a request to receive the code?
Katherine: No, not yet, should I do that?
Pabulo: Yes, please, let me know once it's done
Katherine: Ok, done
Pabulo: Hmm.. I can't see that any code was received..
Katherine: Very odd :/
Katherine: Should I try again?
Pabulo: I think we have a problem
Pabulo: Does it give you an option to change the email address?
Katherine: No, It doesn't. On the Microsoft recovery page, I can only see my personal account
Pabulo: Do you mind if I access the Skype account? I will try to fix it
Katherine: Sure, the password is: 456789 and the user is: kljhg09ghjk

Anna: Yes, I am - it's my honeymoon. :)
Maya: You've got married??
Anna: Yes.:) It was a small ceremony, just for the family and the closest friends.
Maya: We tied the knot just two months after our engagement.
Anna: Why were you in such a hurry? Are you pregnant?
Maya: No, we just wanted to get it over with.
Anna: ??
Maya: We felt so much pressure to organize a perfect wedding, that at one point we reached a breaking point and we were just like 'fuck it, let's just do it'.
Maya: And I'm glad we did it like this. It wasn't worth all the fuss and stress.
Anna: Then I'm happy for you. :) Congratulations!
Maya: Thanks! :)
Anna: So how do you enjoy Greece?
Maya: I LOVE it!! :) Greek food is amazing, the views - even better and the weather is just perfect. :))
Maya: And the Mediterranean Sea... <3 It's a heaven on earth!
Anna: :> When are you going back home?
Maya: In two days, unfortunately. :(
Anna: Would you like to grab a coffee next week? I'd love to see some pictures from your wedding day. :)

Barnaby: I'm in Blackburn, not on the moon! We've had a few Toby Carvery dinners, lots of puds with that!
Jack: Still, not a patch on your Mum's, though! 
Barnaby: Hey, have you seen that dick on the Diet Coke ad yet?
Jack: Oh yeah, that smug twat! That ad is hilarious!
Barnaby: I know, do they think all 20 somethings go around saying things are Super Good, No?
Jack: All while looking like pricks with hipster beards and retro denim jackets! What a fucking tool!
Barnaby: It's all flavoured shite anyway, I avoid sweeteners like the plague, can't stand the aftertaste!
Jack: Me too, Barnes! I get full sugar if I want a coke, just buy it rarely. Hate diet drinks, they taste üí©!
Barnaby: That ad would encourage people to avoid Diet Coke anyway, maybe that's the point!
Jack: LOL. Anyway, how's work in the sunny Blackburn branch?
Barnaby: Much the same as in the Halifax one! When they notice my accent, though, I do get a few comments about being an illegal alien! Banter like that, it's pretty funny, to be fair!
Jack: Sounds hilarious!üòí
Barnaby: Yeah, we Yorkshire folk are being oppressed! Get famous Yorkies like Parkie or James Martin to campaign for our human rights!
Jack: They are too rich to be bothered with us, what about the Tetley Tea Folk?
Barnaby: Yeah, I reckon they'd fight dirty! Nasty little bastards, really!
Jack: Anyway, we miss you at work!
Barnaby: Aww! That's nice of you all! I miss you lot too!
Jack: Yeah, we have to make our own bloody tea now you've got promoted. It's not on!
Barnaby: Sorry man!

Lee: most of my peripherals are from Razer
Lee: and I never had a problem with them
Archie: how's the new one?
Lee: it's hard to get used to the mechanical switches
Lee: but I'm very pleased with the purchase
Archie: it takes some time to adapt from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical one
Lee: I know, that's why I'm not worried at all
Lee: it will get better with every day
Archie: btw how loud is it?
Lee: definitely louder than my last one
Lee: the click is much more defined
Lee: but not to the point it would bother me
Archie: I should switch to a mechanical one as well
Lee: what stops you?
Archie: most of my peripherals are from Logitech
Archie: but so far I can't find any of their mechanical keyboards that suit my needs
Lee: why not buy from another brand?
Archie: probably a question of habit :)
Archie: besides I don't want to install yet another software alongside the Logitech one
Lee: yeah that's annoying
Archie: so I'll either find a good mechanical kb from Logitech or I'll switch all my peripherals at the same time
Archie: either way not on my priority list as long as everything else is working
Lee: well good luck with that!"

Nathalie: Oh no, I need to hand in the other assignment before I can take the exam!!! There's no way I'm going to be done before the 7th! What do I do?!

Eve: no problem, happy to help! What other assignment are you talking about?
Nathalie: Do you remember when I broke my leg and had to have a really intense physio? He agreed for me to hand it one of the papers by the end of the semester 
Martin: Do you need it? I'm sure he won't remember what he read...
Carol: I could use some better grade on one of mine... do you think I could resubmit it?
Nathalie: I'm not sure. He was pretty reluctant to let me do it but I bored him with some lines from the uni constitution and he eventually caved ;)
Carol: well, maybe it's worth a shot...
Eve: A little of top: the second floor in the library is being remodeled or sth and it's going to be inaccessible the entire week starting Monday so if you need anything you still have tomorrow to check it out!
Martin: Damn, I better make my way over there tomorrow, I misplaced my copy of his recommended reading list, does anybody have it?
Eve: I know it makes me sound like a nerd - but I do, I will forward over to you:)
Martin: But you are OUR nerd, Eve, so that's okay :) saving us yet another time
Carol: do you think it's bad i haven't ready any? how important are they for the final?

13717156,"Joona: Hey you two wonderful people, like I said to Kamil already let me know if there's something that you really, really want to do once you're in NY
Kamil: I am getting panicked before Boston
Kamil: so I just want to survive it first
Kamil: but then maybe some art Moma, ESB, maybe ellis island? the statue? but maybe you have some suggestions?
Kamil: oh, and the famous beach place?
Kamil: Anca? any ideas?
Kamil: but we don't need to see all at once. We also need hints how to do it all cheaply üòÇ
Joona: Coney Island? The beach with the amusement park? It's cool, it's just off-season right now, so it's quite empty and eerie üëª
Joona: Ok, I'll think about cheap possibilities and ideas üôÇ Plus you'll nail Boston! (It's also an awesome city!)
Kamil: i think so!
Kamil: hmm, it's so much to see, but I would also rely on your opinions :) you've been there for a while
Anca: Oh god Joona, how nice to care for us lost people, facing the ultimate metropolis for the first time
Anca: If Kamil is afraid of Boston, I am afraid of being send back by the homeland security, as it happened to me in the UK before taking the Italian citizenship, so I still can't quite believe that I will get to New York üòÖ
Anca: But, just in case, I would like to do Moma and the empire state building, I am not sure about a show on Broadway. And I would like to see coney island out of season, as you might have noticed already, we like absurd things üòÖ
Anca: And the Brooklyn Bridge but I don't know, do these things need to be arranged, or one can just go? Moma for example, or the esb?
Joona: Well, maybe planned is a better word for it üòÄ Like if you want to see a show on Broadway, queuing for cheap tickets is a special process. And Guggenheim, for example, is pay-what-you-wish on Saturday evenings, Whitney on Friday evenings - MoMA sadly is always the same price but I'll make some kind of list of things üôÇ
Anca: So yes, we need some plans!
Anca: Oh thank you üòç How is the weather? Decent?
Joona: At the moment it's cold and first snow came last week
Anca: In Bucharest as well
Joona: But decent, beats rain
Anca eui: So nothing shocking I suppose
Joona: No, just keep an eye out for the forecast before you leave to Boston as 1) it can change really quickly here 2) Boston can be extremely cold with the wind and all
Anca: So probably colder than NY? Ok, we will try to arrive there prepared
Joona: üòÇ
Anca: Ok, for now both cities are warmer than Bucharest. But the cold doesn't scare me too much
Kamil: I will buy new shoesüòÇ but that's great you know when and where are free options!ü§©
Kamil: a real NYC-know-how

Pat: I like the background design of the first one.
Gaby: But don't you think the font is too extravagant?
Pat: Just a bit, that's why in the end my pick is the third one.

13681080,"Paul: So, what's your take on this caravan business then?
Bob: Very strange. Why are they only doing this now?
Paul: In what sense?
Bob: Why only now, with a very anti-immigration president, do they try to walkk in in large numbers. They had poverty and a desire to come to the US during the time of previous administrations, but only now are they coming in a big organised march like this.
Paul: I see what you mean. The timing is strange, and around the mid-term elections. but maybe it is because this is the last chance.
Bob: You mean before the wall is finished. I have no idea if and when they will actually finish all of that.
Paul: Probably they got inspired by what happened in Europe, how all those migrants got through into Europe and they are still there, nobody for sure knows how many.
Bob: Mayba, but this is a different country and the geograpy is very different. 
Paul: For sure they are getting a lot of help from someone.
Bob: It did look on the media as if ordinary Mexicans were helping them.
Paul: I have a friend down there, Raul, he tells me that nobody is helping them and that the pictures on the news of Mexicans helping out of the goodness of their hearts is just to make it look like Soros isn't funding it.
Bob: Presumably some Mexicans will be giving them some charity
Paul: Nobody. Ninguno. Nada. No Mexican is gonna give them jack shit because every one of them has a relative or friend who signed the proper application form and is waiting. They cannot stand these queue jumpers. If they were not being guarded by their organisers, the ordinary Mexicans would be beating them up.
Bob: Well it's interesting, what you say.
Paul: I just don't know what's gonna happen when they actually get to the border in big numbers.
Bob: We won't have long to wait before we find out. 
Paul: If we really do find out the truth.
Bob: I wish they had webcams along the border so that we can see for ourselves. I can't trust the media anymore.
Paul: You have to watch every side because they are all lying about everything and sometimes the truth is in the middle.
Bob: They even doctor the videos, and sometimes the videos are not doctored and the other side claims that they are.
Paul: We live in very difficult times. It seems to be difficult to be sure about anything."

Ivan: Do you thnik that Putin could openly invade a neighbouring state?
Vasily: I understand and share your concerns, Ivan.
Vasily: First, the Crimea was taken over by ""Little green men"" who were in fact Russian soldiers.
Vasily: Second, Russian troops were sent to occupy Donets Basin to the east of Ukraine...
Vasily: All this may spell serious trouble...
Dimitri: That's true gentlemen, the situation seems to be getting more and more tense every month
Dimitri: Vasili haven't mentioned the most recent accident in which Russian coast guard ships fired on Ukrainian navy vessels near the Kerch Strait
Ivan: This is actually what I was thinking about when I started this conversation.
Ivan: But the circumstances of the accident are not completely clear.
Dimitri: Yes, there has been a great argument over which side is responsible for this accident.
Vasily: I'm not entirely familiar with the accident at Kerch but common sense tells that Russia is to be blamed, as usual...
Dimitri: Indeed, this is what most people have already assumed.
Dimitri: However, in this particular situation it might be the Ukrainian side that initiated the conflict.
Dimitri: In fact, it enabled Petro Poroshenko to declare martial law in Ukraine, which may be a political gimmick beneficial for him in terms of the forthcoming presidential election in 2019.
Ivan: Wow, this would be a perfect example supporting the idea that politics is a dirty business...
Vasily: My God, but if it turns out to be true, the safety of entire state is at stake!
Dimitri: It should not be a surprice if I told you that the interests of oligarchs have been always more important for the people dealing with politics in Ukraine then the good of the state itself...
Vasily: It is ubelievable that such things still happen in the 21st century, wow.
Ivan: Yes, and ordinary people, lives of millions of innocent people are meaningless in this game...
Dimitri: This is a very sad conclusion but, to be honest, it has been like that since the history remembers.
Vasily: Very sad vision, indeed. We can only hope that the future would be better time to live.

John: Yes, there are also people doing ""scientifically"" tarot, horoscopes and astrology.

Olivia: only for one night. We'll  ask  them to  come with sleeping bags and i'll invited them all for meals.
Olivia: i've found a nice small place, with a kitchen and everything we'll need. Not expansive. We can cancel  at  the  last  moment.
Megan: how many answer do you have?
Olivia: for now we should be 25, but William's children didn't answer yes.Did you find a good caterer?
Megan: Chris will take in charge all the beverages and we could cook ourselves the  main course and dessert. 
Olivia: so the caterer would only do the fingerfood?

Anna: btw let me know how the movie was
Savannah:  Gaah! Everything is happening on Friday. I have plans with Ada to go to my yoga class on Friday, but you guys will probably be there late, right? I will definitely stop by later :)
Savannah: Also, the movie was good. Definitely interesting, and I enjoyed the theme. 
Savannah: It didn't have a wow effect, but I definitely recommend
Anna: cool 
Anna: too bad you can't be there earlier, but i'll live :) 
Anna: I have the workshop sat morning so I'll probably stay till midnight or so

Savannah: I wanna go to the workshop as well

Anna: it's by the subway
Anna: and then a short walk

Ann: We never know what expects us tomorrow
Kelly: But maybe it's how it should be
Jenny: Yes
Jenny: a partner is not a dog
Jenny: They are free to go away any minute
Ann: Or a Disney princess (I am watching sleeping beauty now on TV)
Kelly: üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yes, so they have the right to leave us and we should be able to see life after them always
Ann: Yes, this is the biggest problem of the ideology of love. The idea that love is life. Love has been equated with life. Especially for women, but not only, also for men. People can't imagine life without it
Kelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life
Ann: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama
Ann: It's not even a very beautiful dream to be with someone all your life. The promise of no change. Stability forever. It is what capitalism needs from us - 40 years of mortgage and marriage
Kelly: Ahaha, yes and that somebody will take care of us when we are sick. 
Ann: Love is beautiful, intense, crazy and brief. And it was transformed in a long lasting good, a house. Something like this.
Kelly: But i think, or I suppose that we should be able to love for life potentially. We cannot approach love with a plan
Ann: Yes, sure, but a substantial group of people, not one. But the problem is that love is mostly approached with one plan. Being together, get married, etc
Ann: Or now, under the new regime of supposed sexual freedom, with the opposite plan: nothings lasts and love doesn't matter. But this is substituting an ideology with another, when we should just let it be.
Ann: Simply üòÖ
Kelly: Yes, I agree
Jenny: and most of all this myth of love as life is a disappointing lie that makes people suffer a lot
Ann: Yes, the dependency that it creates is horrible
Ann: I see it with my friends, it breaks my heart
Kelly: sounds sad"

Diane: Hey, weekend was great. Too short, as always. We had a few people over Saturday but nothing too extravagant.
Larry: I guess I missed the invite!
Diane: Not at all, just a few people decided to randomly show up. I'm just lucky I decided not to wear pjs all day, it would ve been awkward.
Larry: I see. Did you have fun though?
Diane: Yeah it was great. The weather turned out to be awesome so we ended up just goofing off in the pool. 
Larry: Sounds fun! I wish we had a pool.
Diane: Yeah, tbh it's just a hole in your pocket most the time. We literally use it a few times a year.
Larry: Really?! Why? I wouldn't leave it in the summer!
Diane: Idk why. Seems like a good idea in theory... you still gotta pay maintenance every month... we just had to shell out 500 bucks for new pool cleaner.because it randomly decided to stop working. 
Larry: WOW, that is a lot of money, maybe it's just better to have a friend with a pool instead LOL
Diane: Exactly!! but it's not like we can just poor concrete over it and be done 
Larry: Ha ha! Not random at all! 
Diane: Yeah, our pool company wouldnt be too crazy about it, I bet. You dont'r happen to be looking for a new house with a pool, do ya?
Larry: well. we ve been looking at some properties down south but market is insane atm. I think we will wait until it drops.
Diane: Good plan/ But it might take a while, so I hear.
Larry: We're not in a hurry, thank god. We still like the house we're at. Maybe want something bigger in the future but nothing urgent/
Diane: I see... I kinda wish we hadn'tt got such a big one to begin with. Cleaning is a nightmare and our usual cleaner moved away so we gotta find someone new.
Larry: Sure you can find someone on fb, try some local groups, people offer all sort of services all the time. 
Diane: Yeah, thats probably what we're gonna end up doing. All i've seen so far has been really expensive but these were regular companies so perhaps fb can help."

Diego: Maybe NASA screwed the entire humankind, I can't tell you :D
Greg: The American flag is flying on the recorded movie
Greg: There's no wind on the Moon so how the hell is that possible?!
Greg: The rocks found on the Moon are similar to the ones that are common in Antarctica
Greg: There're no stars on the photos taken on the Moon's surface
Greg: And finally a misterious death of the project's participants
Greg: 12 of them died tragically within a few years...
Diego: That's all thought-provoking, I agree
Diego: But I think that if you'd look for some reasonable explanations, you'll find them
Diego: I take all those conspiracy theories with a grain of salt
Diego: Don't let them bother your mind
Diego: Rather accept them as a kind of entertainment

13731489,"Henning: You wanna hear something weird?
Max: yes, always!
Henning: Recently somehow we talked about waiters/waitresses. And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.
Henning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.
Henning: Somehow, because their status is higher.
Max: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.
Henning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.
Max: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well
Henning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.
Max: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.
Henning: Berlin is a big city though
Max: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid
Henning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.
Max: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.
Max: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city.

Max: And then one is confused about his/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture/climate/language/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.

Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it
Mary: oh god
Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck
Mary: What did you tell him?
Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.
Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that
Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once

Kate: Yes :/
Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much

13680292,"Brenda: Hello bro, you've got an invalid sister. I fell in the bathroom and badly hit my side. Can hardly move now.
Andy: Good gracious! How did you manage that?
Brenda: The floor was wet after I had a shower and I wanted to shake the rug, moved too fast, slipped, and hit with a thump my left side below the breast against the edge of the bathtub. Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....
Andy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?
Brenda: In bed. But I can hardly move. It's very painful all over the body. SHIIIIT!
Andy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?
Brenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.
Andy: Can you breath normally?
Brenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.
Andy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?
Brenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.
Andy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.
Andy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?
Brenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...
Andy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.
Brenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.
Andy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.
Brenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.
Andy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.
Brenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.
Andy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.
Brenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.
Andy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep. Have a good rest!

Dora: Oh Laura I feel like weeping... So much emotion...
Laura: I wish I could take you in my arms!
Dora: Instead I am cuddling up to me this doll. Oh dear...
Laura: You are such a lovely and sensitive and emotional being.
Dora: And the one who loves old-fashioned dolls! :)
Laura: But it is good! Just think about the doll as a present from Aitra.
Dora: And from you!
Laura: I feel so good knowing how important it all is for you.
Dora: Thank you very, very much, Laura.
Laura: My pleasure."

Sandra: No, it's too cold. I am going to get sick. And you George ?
George: Of course I will. With winter coming, I have to make some sport if I don't want to get fat
Jane: Good point George. Don't you think he's right, Sandra ?
Sandra: Fat or not, I don't want to get sick, it is terribly cold now
Jane: Don't exagerate, it's only 10 degrees
Sandra: Exactly what I told you, it's cold
Jane: And seeing George in swimsuit is not enough to make you change your mind :)) ?
Sandra: It's a tempting idea, but still don't want to be chilled because of this f**g swimming-pool
George: Thank you girls for your compliment
Jane: There's no compliment at all
George: But I see the pleasure of seeing me is not strong enough to make Sandra go to the swimming pool with us :)
Jane: Or your musculature not attractive enough!! lol
Sandra: It has nothing to do with it, I just DO NOT want to go to the swimming-pool, OK ?
Jane: Sandra, you're blushing
Sandra: No, I'm not !!!
George: Girls, let's stop arguing. What about going alltogether to the swimming-pool and having a fine dinner afterwards with a hot cup of tea ?
Sandra: OK, good idea with this hop cup of tea !
George: Great ! So see you at the swimming-pool !

13680284,"Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!
Harry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!
Tessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?
Harry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.
Tessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?
Harry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.
Tessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL
Harry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?
Tessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?
Harry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.
Tessy: Smashing! Where to?
Harry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.
Tessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?
Harry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.
Tessy: Apart from royals in Kitzb√ºhel :)) 
Harry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.
Tessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!
Harry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.
Tessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)
Harry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.
Tessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.
Harry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.
Tessy: STB you are.
Harry: What the hell is STB?
Tessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!
Tessy: And have a fantastic skiing Xmas!
Harry: Happy and safe trails Tessy!"

Vincent: Hello Victor.
Victor: Good morning sir.
Victor: I applied for a vacant sit in your company
Vincent: What's your name?
Victor: My name is Victor
Vincent: What's your father's name?
Victor:  Dr. Noel.
Vincent: Your father is a doctor? but you chose to be an engineer. Why?
Victor: It's because I have no aptitude for medical profession.
Vincent: Don't you want to serve the suffering humanity?
Victor: Humanity is suffering in all aspects sir. So I have an equal opportunity to serve the suffering in my field.
Vincent: I can see you graduated in 2010. What have you been doing since then?
Victor: I'm looking for some proper job, sir.
Vincent: What do you mean by proper job?
Victor: A job where I could have an opportunity to exploit my abilities but not where the employer will exploit me.
Vincent: Why didn't you join a Government department?
Victor: The first thing is that Government has limited jobs to offer because of the world wide economic recession. The second thing is that in the Government departments both the idle and the ideal are treated in the same manner. The idle ones have no fear to be deprived of their jobs while the ideal have no hope for any rapid progress.
Vincent: Victor your CV shows that you have been a very bright student throughout your academic career. You have won many distinctions and have visited a number of countries. If you think you can't make any progress in Pakistan why don't you try your luck in  another country, let's say in America or England.
Victor: I didn't say that I can't make any progress in Pakistan. I am determined to stay in Pakistan and I strive hard to prove my worth. But sir I need a proper platform from where I can start my journey. And I think your company can provide me one as you appreciate qualification and not recommendation.
Vincent: OK  Victor I think you are the man we are looking for. Please, keep in touch. We will inform you within a week. Good luck.
Victor: Thank you very much, sir."

Melanie: Do you think she'd share the recipe?
Tracy: Oh I'm sure she will. She'll be proud to. Shall I ask?
Melanie: Please do! I'd appreciate it.
Tracy: Hi Melanie, just talked with Amelia. She said the green tomato chutney is just like any other chutney, only you add green tomatoes. That's it.
Melanie: How about proportions? How much tomatoes and how much onion and other ingredients?
Tracy: I think she said tomatoes come instead of 1/4 of apples.
Melanie: So it's not only tomatoes?
Tracy: Of course not. It would be just bitter. I think.
Melanie: Do I have then to pre-prepared the tomatoes? I suppose they're quite bitter when green.
Tracy: You're right. I'll ask her.
Melanie: Maybe she's got a recipe written down or something?
Tracy: Sorry for not answering at once! So busy now. So I asked Amelia about green tomatoes for chutney and she said she didn't as you say pre-prepare them. But they are always her own tomatoes, from the garden, and she has these sweet cherry tomatoes.
Melanie: A! That makes a whole lot of difference! So I'm afraid I can't imitate her recipe :(
Tracy: She's send me a link to BBCFood. They have wonderful things there. I'll forward it to you.
Tracy: <file_link> Green Tomato Apple Chutney.

Terry: Ok, on my way, will be home in 10

Joanna: I had a chance to have a quick look and I think it's a really good project, so I have only a few minor remarks. The layout is great, but maybe it could be improved if you moved it slightly more to the centre?
Terry: Yeah, I was thinking the same, but couldn't make it.
Joanna: ok, ok! If you turn the help lines function on in the view panel it will be much easier. Every time you move an element all the lines will appear with all necessary parameters written on them, so you can make sure that everything is at the same height or is within the same distance.

Julian: no they are not, which is cool and worrying! 
Hetty: yeah of course. Do they attack humans?
Julian: Not really, they generallyare too scared. there have been reports of city foxes nibbling on little kids in cots though üò± 
Hetty: yuk! that's pretty scary!
Julian: Yeah I guess they are predators when given the opportunity!
Julian: <file_photo> this one is not as clear as I tried to zoom in
Julian: it's rare to see two together though, generally they roam on their own
Hetty: and not during the day?
Julian: that too. This was very early morning though
Hetty: so what are they doing in your garden? what do they eat?
Julian: peoples rubbish and rats I guess, birds, eggs maybe?
Julian: we see a lot of opened bin bags lying around on bin day. Makes a right mess!
Hetty: at least you don't have rats now! 
Julian: I know, and I definitely prefer the foxes. besides the mess and sometimes evry stinky poo they don't bother me. 
Hetty: they are quite beautiful aren't they
Julian: I think so!  pretty cool!
Julian: some people feed them in their garden to have them come back, but I don't think Tinkerbell would like that much! 
Hetty: I guess cats and foxes don't mix?
Julian: she's petrified! 
Hetty: better not then, poor thing!"

Daniel: I know it might not be the most useful advice but I would start at the beginning :P
Jeff: Very funny...
Daniel: I'm serious.
Daniel: There are lots of ""recommended"" patterns when dealing with Discworld series.
Daniel: But for me the answer is simple.
Daniel: Just start with the first book and follow the order in which they were released.
Jeff: So why people recommend a different approach?
Daniel: There are many sub-series within Discworld.
Daniel: Rincewind, Witches, City Watch, Death and so on.
Daniel: Some prefer to read it that way to focus on one set of characters.
Jeff: Okay but you still think I should read everything in order?
Daniel: That is what I did.
Daniel: Especially that there are characters that appear across several series.
Daniel: So that way you won't miss anything.
Jeff: Oh now I get it.
Jeff: I'll just follow your advice.

Frank: Yes! I've been wanting to ask you! How is it? In comparison with PC?
Kim: Honestly? I love it.
Kim: I know that many would like to stone me for saying that, but I don't see that much difference with PC and it's faaaar more comfortable.
Frank: Even the graphics? I've heard you will never have the same effect on PS as on PC.
Kim: Well, it's true, but I mostly enjoy the plot, the mechanics etc, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on something.
Frank: Hm... interesting.
Kim: If you're more into graphics than you can always watch some videos on YouTube where people compare PC and PS, but, to my mind, the differences are minimal.
Kim: Also, if you really want to have amazing graphics you need quite a powerful PC, PS is more affordable.
Frank: yeah, but games are more expensive.
Kim: Not on Cyber Monday :D depends how much you play, it usually takes me quite a while to finish one.
Frank: I'm more an occasional player, so I don't if there's any point.

Anton: Nooo... but that paired up with all the other examples AND witnesses like me or Frank, then we might have a solid case on our hands :) Look, it's worth a shot
Eve: *Sigh*
Eve: If you say so... honestly, I'm not convinced. So what does Miss Glorious want with me now?
Anton: She didn't say :/ But I can always try to get you out of there if things get rough
Eve: My hero *swoon*

Donnie: He got robbed in Paris. 1200 dollars.

13828915,"William: Hello Morah! A new update on our whereabouts. Just moved over to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. Empty roads giving you a weird feeling.
William: <file_photo>
William: We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation and after much asking around and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house. It turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.
William: <file_photo>
William: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep and are looking forward to do some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan.
Morah: So good to hear from you! The house looks very comfortable indeed.
William: We even have two bedrooms but Sarah's bravely putting up with my snoring so we're using only one ;-)
Morah: You even seem to have a small terrace in front of the house. Quite posh!
William: We tried to have our sundowner on it yesterday but mosquitoes from the whole neighbourhood decided to join us, so we had to withdraw before they'd sucked us bloodless.
Morah: Too bad! It looks a pretty area around the house though.
William: We have a very pleasant parkland just in front of the house, even with a small Maya ruin. But they seem to be everywhere!
Morah: Have you consulted Hobbs on its name? I bet he knows everything about every ruin in Mexico.
William: Only in the Yucatan peninsula. About the rest of Maya monuments he knows only 99%. He keeps giving us invaluable tips and pieces of advice. Grand chap!
Morah: Yes, he is. And not this type of a boring, dried-up professor one might expect. I quite like him too.
William: I know you do ;)
Morah: I don't even see as much of him.
William: As you would love to.
Morah: :D
William: Once we are back we'll invite you two for a slide show, right?
Morah: And maybe two other people in order not to make it too obvious?
William: Granted!
Morah: Oh so lovely chatting with you. Have a great time travelling. And keep me posted.
William: I will. Take care!"

John: In general, if I were buying it for myself it would need a serious overhaul, but as a rental should be ok
Alan: So what's stopping you? You don't seem all that enthusiastic
John: The rent is rather high so I would expect a bit more for that money
Alan: Well, then try to negotiate, if she's been renting it already for some time then she knows the game :) You always set the price higher in case you find someone who would be willing to pay it :)

Tim: you can always use an electric kettle you know?
Kate: haha! Not funny!
Kate: it‚Äôs easier to clean as well.
Harry: I‚Äôd go for induction cause it keeps the temp after you finish cooking so the food is still warm

Grant: what's up?
Jacqueline: i'm choosing my courses for next semester and i don't know if I should take intro to sociology
Grant: you should, it's really good and professor Gartenberg is awesome
Jacqueline: that's the thing, Gartenberg retired last term, now it's someone else teaching it
Grant: do you know who?
Jacqueline: professor Edwards
Grant: stay away from him!!!
Jacqueline: why?
Grant: his classes are boring and he's very subjective when grading papers
Jacqueline: what do you mean?
Grant: I've heard that if he doesn't like you, you'll get a bad grade even if your term paper is perfect
Jacqueline: yeah, you're right, i should avoid that class
Grant: like the plague!!!!
Jacqueline: Any other recommendations?
Grant: 19th century literature is really good
Jacqueline: would you recommend that over intro to philosophy?
Grant: nope, you should take 19th century lit
Jacqueline: ok, thanks for the tip!
Grant: you're very welcome."

13829840,"Moira: Hello dear Barbie, greetings from Havana! I thought you might like a few pics of the city you'd told me so much about. My footnote to our talks about art deco:
Moira: <file_photo>
Moira: You can probably recognise these, as they are all in the centre of Havana. But I also found some fine examples of the style in the suburbs:
Moira: <file_photo>
Barbie: Hello dear! Thank you for the pics. Splendid as usual. I especially like your take of Hotel Nacional. At first I didn't recognise the zoomed tympana. They are gorgeous, aren't they?
Moira: I waited till late afternoon to get them. But they're  sort obvious, anyone can see them. I'm quite proud about my finds in the suburbs.
Moira: <file_photo>
Barbie: Indeed! Fantastic in design but in a horrific state of preservation, aren't they?
Moira: Some of them would be deemed uninhabitable in Europe but here they can house even a few families. That's post-Fidel Cuba for you!
Barbie: Politics aside they are supreme piece of architecture that should be taken care of. Any movement, initiative into this direction?
Moira: Not to my knowledge as far as the suburbs are concerned. The ones that are successful are active in the areas under the UNESCO World Heritage patronage.
Barbie: Have you been to Vedado? Seen villas there?
Moira: Yep. Fantastic. But wept over their condition. They really don't know what sort of treasures they have.
Barbie: I know! That ""remodelling"" should send them to prison, if you ask me. I photographed one shocking example of it and sent it to ""Architectural Review"" to be put on file. They were quite obliging, I must say.
Barbie: <file_photo>
Barbie: How did you discover these houses in the suburbs!?
Moira: By accident. I went on a tour of the city in an open-top bus and had a glimpse of some from the top deck. Took snaps with their GPS location and came back. By taxi.
Barbie: Splendid!!! If you have some more or less complete series of photos of singular objects with their GPS, we can assemble a portfolio and submit it to ""Architectural Review"". They are usually not only pleased but also pay for valuable contributions.
Moira: I would be flattered! I'll show you what I've got when I'm back home.
Barbie: Which is?
Moira: End of January.
Barbie: Looking forward to our meeting then.
Moira: Me too! Thanks for your suggestion.
Barbie: Pleasure. So good luck and keep photographing.

Rachel: What, sorry?
Donna: I mean, I assume, he's got into a Russell Group university, I mean the others are ok, but really, you know, not that good!
Rachel: I honestly don't know. He got the grades, was accepted and he's going. Simple as. We're all very proud of him, actually. He's saving up for a car now.
Donna: Well, as long as you're all happy with it, that's fine. We can't all be high fliers.
Rachel: Now, hang on a sec, Donna. You're my cousin and we've always got on well, but I'm not going to put my son down and ruin his happiness just because he didn't get bleeding A* grades! 
Donna: No, of course. I'm sure you've been as supportive as you are able to be. I believe in really pushing children to achieve.
Rachel: God, you are really something, Donna! Jay is a happy, confident boy and I leave him to his own devices because I trust him!
Donna: Well, Oliver has downloaded his reading list already and is working through them. The competition to stand out in law is fierce. A little encouragement wouldn't go amiss for Jay.
Rachel: Ok, I've had enough of this conversation! Jay is well adjusted and people like him. That's more than I can say for Oliver!
Donna: Well, we'll see about that in 5 years time when Oliver is earning 6 figures and Jay is still scraping a living doing his weird so-called art!

Dave: And here's the link to the shelter where I found Trixie :) <file_other>
Jane: Wow! Thanks Dave!
Dave: No problem. I'm happy to hear that someone's considering adopting a dog instead of buying one.
Jane: I thought about buying, because I love pugs and other small dogs. I was reading about them and I found out that they have a lot health issues.
Jane: I don't want to buy a dog that's going to die in three years or I spend all days at the vet.
Dave: It's actually proven that mutt's have much better health than purebred dogs.
Jane: That's why I've heard too. So I thought it may be a better idea to adopt :)
Dave: See, I've always dreamed about a German shepherd, but then I went to the shelter with my friend and found Trixie :)
Dave: Adopting a dog is not as easy as it may seem, but I think that's good. I was asked to fill in a questionnaire, had two interviews (;)) and a trial walk, before they agreed to give me Trixie. So be prepared to have your flat checked and everything.
Jane: I don't mind that at all.
Dave: Here's Trixie :) <file_photo>
Jane: She's sooo cute! <3
Jane: I'm only afraid they won't let me adopt a dog, because I've never had one.
Dave: Oh don't worry about that! I didn't have one either!
Dave: Go to the webpage I sent you, or a find a different shelter, and look at the dogs that are waiting for adoption. We all have our preferences, but I advise you to be honest with the caretakers and tell them what kind of dog you would like to have.
Jane: Thank you! What if I like a dog that will not be suitable for me?
Dave: Hm, I'd rather go for the personality than for the looks, same with people I guess ;) I'd prefer my friends to be nice than pretty ;)
Jane: It's true, sounds logical ;)
Dave: If you have any doubts or questions, do not hesitate to ask me. I went the same road, so I hope I may be able to help you.

Amelie: hehe, Guardian again :P
Rose: sure, I like them!
Amelie: it's quite interesting
Rose: it is, but also maybe a bit naive?
Amelie: Yes, like comparing Europe nowadays to Europe in 536 is a bit simplistic.
Rose: True, people had different expectations then, perceptions, believes etc. Also imagination of what was possible or not.
Amelie: Exactly!
Rose: Like the volcanic eruptions they read as the anger of God.
Amelie: on the other hand, we have this kind of people here and now as well.
Rose: Good point. They vote for Trump
Amelie: So maybe it's not that stupid, the article. Maybe we've never changed, as humans
Rose: At least not as much as we would like to believe.
Amelie: Which is a beautiful but also sad realisation.
Rose: Look at all this racism and xenophobia around the world right now. If not even IIww and Holocaust has changed us, what could?
Amelie: nothing, I am afraid.
Rose: We just keep repeating the same stories all the time.
Amelie: Over and over again.
Rose: God, how depressing!
Amelie: Anyway, I have to come back to work. This sad truth about life never changes as well - we have to work.
Rose: And we become our work.

Tom: That's why we want to meet with you to discuss it and offer you the opportunity of working with us. Meet you at 7:20pm on Stokes Croft?
Jim: That sounds interesting and thank you for offering me the opportunity of meeting with you but I would really like to know more about the project so I can prepare myself.
Jim: Can you please tell me what the project is about? When does it start? How long does it go for? And  is it paid or unpaid?
Tom: Dude we're offering you and opportunity to meet with us and discuss the project. I don't talk about project details online with no one. It is highly confidential.
Tom: So are you meeting with us or not tonight?
Jim: I would love to but I really need to know a little bit more about it so I can decide if it something that I would be interested in.
Tom: What part of we want to meet with you don't you understand?
Tom: We're offering you an opportunity to work with us and some very well known people. If you want to know more you have to come to the meeting.
Jim: OK. But is it a paid project?
Tom: I don't discuss money online.
Tom: I think you're not understanding me here. I'm giving you an opportunity to get somewhere with your work and you're trying to dictate terms to me.
Tom: I think this opportunity isn't right for you mate. I need people with passion and dedication and you don't sound to me like you're one of those.
Jim: Of course I might be potentially interested but like anyone else I need to pay rent, bills and buy food and opportunity doesn't pay the bills nor does exposure or experience.
Jim: So with all due respect unless you can give me a small brief about the project it is really hard for me to say yes.
Tom: Fine have ti your way. Your loss.
Tom: I'll just contact your competition and offer them the opportunity.
Jim: Please do.
Tom: I will! With that attitude you'll never get anywhere in life! Wanker!"

Andrea: The longest I could resist smoking was like 2 weeks but it always comes back like a boomerang...
Thomas: I quit after 7 years
Thomas: That was a terrible battle!
Andrea: How did you manage to do that after all that time?!
Thomas: It was a combination of a good strategy and the power of will
Jacob: I think I know what you mean
Jacob: Was it like reducing the amount of cigarettes periodically?
Thomas: Something like that plus trying to draw attention from any thought urging me to reach for a cig
Andrea: It seems so simple but once you try, you realize that it's not that easy :/
Thomas: True. But look, Andrea, Jacob has taken the bull by the horns and succeeded
Jacob: Thanks Thomas, at least I'm trying.
Jacob: But sometimes it's extremely hard to resist temptation...
Thomas: Yes, definitely. Especially at the initial stage of the process
Andrea: But you know guys, all that you've written here so far feels like kind of motivation for me, as strange as it may sound
Andrea: Because, you know... If you two could, why can't I?
Jacob: Of course, you should try again!
Thomas: Don't you even hesitate. Just think to yourself in this way:
Thomas: This is a little awful cigarette, every time I light it up it kills me, it smells bad to me and to others, more money is lost and actually it holds power over me. Why would I be a slave of a small shitty thing like that? I'm strong enough to resist it, I'm bigger than that!
Andrea: All right! I just need to keep convincing myself that I'm bigger than that!
Thomas: Just be consistent in doing so :)
Jacob: And buy a lot of sweets, you'll need them. At the beginning at least :D
Thomas: Right, they can soften the shock after quitting smoking.

Mell: Not much happening either. An odd phone call with the kids. Or Tad's sister:(( Not much otherwise.
Gloria: Yeah... Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. We had more to get used to it. But it must hard for you. Especially you I mean.
Mell: I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now.
Gloria: Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now.
Mell: I guess you're right. But maybe I should feel guilty or something?
Gloria: Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom.
Mell: Thanks Gloria.
Gloria: Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again.
Mell: YES! Splendid!
Gloria: The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. What do you think?
Mell: I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it.
Gloria: Can't be better. I love your garden.
Mell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion.
Gloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it.
Mell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose?
Gloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday?
Mell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks?
Gloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well. 
Mell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you.
Gloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister?
Mell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too.
Gloria: Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her.
Mell: Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her.
Gloria: Yes, we are. Oh I'm so happy you've phoned!
Mell: Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday!

Kelly: Oh my God, Joe Johnson, it's been YEARS!
Joe: Yes, I've been working abroad for the last 3 years, Italy, actually!
Kelly: Wow! Was that with your girlfriend, Josie?
Joe: Yes, we actually got married out there 2 years ago! Unfortunately, it didn't last that long and we split after a year and a half.
Kelly: So sorry to hear that, Joe! What happened?
Joe: Well, she was working all over the place and I hardly saw her, I was staying in her parent's house and working at her brother's garage.
Kelly: Hmm, I can sense a ""but"" coming up!
Joe: Yes, well, I'm not proud of this, but her sister came back after Uni and one night we got a bit tiddly on Prosecco and brandy, not a great combo!
Kelly: I think I can guess the rest of the sorry tale. Why were they all living out there anyway? 
Joe: Well, if you remember, Josie' s last name is Andellino and her dad had gone back to where he'd come from to look after his mum and dad. Anyway, I came clean to Josie and told her what happened. We struggled on for a few more months, but she was away so often and we decided to call it a day.
Kelly: Now you're back in lovely Newport after the splendour of Rome!
Joe: Right enough. Got my old job back with Tony too! How's the bank?
Kelly: Still there! I've moved into training and my line manager is retiring soon, soon, you never know, another promotion may be on the cards!
Joe: Pleased for you, Kels! You are a real people person!
Kelly: Thanks Joe! Now what about that drink?
Joe: Good memory, Kelly! Tell you what, I'll pop into the bank when it closes Friday and we'll decide then. Tony won't mind me nipping out half an hour early, I do plenty of overtime!
Kelly: Sounds ace, Joe! Looking forward to it!
Joe: Arriverderci, bella!

13680702,"Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?
Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!
Sophie: Thank you for the quince!"

Penelope: I'm really happy that the democrats pulled through and went out to vote. 
Carlos: I wonder if voter turnout was higher than in other years. 
Penelope: I'm sure there are some statistics out there than have looked into it. 
Carlos: I was a little disappointed that we didn't take the Senate.
Penelope: Same. I kind of thought we would take everything back. 
Carlos: I know right! What with all the excitement and activism going on around us, I thought it would be like a blue wave.

Crystal: there's some new games coming out that my old computer won't be able to handle and they're PC-only
Mel: I get it but I still think that's overkill
Mel: gaming laptops aren't the best investment if you ask me...

Josie: Ciao, Stefano!
Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it?
Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.
Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P
Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.
Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.
Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?
Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.
Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.
Stefano: Really? What did he say?
Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.
Stefano: What? Rotfl!
Josie: That's what Salman said...
Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...
Josie: De gustiBus!

Jessie: Omg, so jealous. How's Montreal? I was thinking about going to Canada, but it's so huge it's hard to say where to go to...
Barbara: I would definitely recommend Montreal, it has a nice European vibe, even though you can that you're definitely not in Europe, if you know what I mean.
Jessie: Kind of. What about other cities?
Barbara: Ottawa and Toronto are already, although I prefer Toronto. Not too keen on Quebec.
Jessie: Oh, why is that? :o
Barbara: I don't know, maybe it's the French thing ;)
Jessie: Hahaha, I get that :D
Barbara: But to be fair it's a nice city, maybe just not for me. I think if I'd known French, it could have been different.
Jessie: I can relate. It's been exactly the same in Paris. Loved the city, but the whole experience was a bit weird with the waiters outraged that we didn't speak French.
Barbara: Kind of the same in Quebec then ;) Although they do have beautiful architecture and city landscape. If you have chance, go there, I'd give them another chance.
Jessie: Weren't you thinking about going to the US when you were already so close?
Barbara: Not really, I've been to the East Coast already, so it wasn't so tempting. Maybe next year I'd venture somewhere more West... :D

Charles: yes!
Breanna: so first, where should we go?

Charles: 3. something exotic
Breanna: 4. something safe (no Dominican Rep, Haiti, Morocco etc)
Breanna: so what could it be?
Jade: Madagascar would be amazing, but not so safe
Breanna: exactly, other options?
Charles: Bali? or too banal
Breanna: ü§Æ banal as fuck!
Charles: but everything ""warm and safe with water"" is banal!
Breanna: but Bali is the archetype of summer banality 
Jade: what about the Maldives? 
Charles: no, too expensive
Jade: Mauritius?

Jade: so let's do it
Breanna: ok, let's research on Mauritius and talk tomorrow if it's a place for us

Jessica: You mean the restaurant?
Robert: Yeah, it's Italian, isn't it?
Jessica: I've been there last week, just when it opened
Robert: Is it any good?
Jessica: Honestly? I think it was awful really
Robert: That bad? but they serve pizza
Jessica: Their problem is that they serve everything. They have pizza and kebab and some Thai and Chinese
Robert: Hm, it does sound weird. I just saw that they have pizza
Jessica: Probably the owners couldn't agree on the cuisine. I don't know, but the result is awful
Jessica: I went there with Mary and basically nothing was good. I had a pepperoni pizza and a drink, she ordered something Thai, I don't know what it was, but she said it was terrible
Robert: Eh, I was hoping that maybe we have a decent restaurant nearby, at last!
Jessica: Don't you like La Toscana?
Robert: I do, but it's just one restaurant in the neighbourhood. I love pizza but not that much
Jessica: Ok, I get it. I don't mind as for me Italian cuisine is the best cuisine in the world ;)
Robert: It's great, but it's quite surprising that there's no Chinese or Vietnamese nearby
Jessica: You sure? I think Greg was telling me he's ordering his favourite nems and he doesn't live that far away from us
Robert: Interesting... I need to talk to him then, I googled for restaurants with delivery but nothing came up
Jessica: Maybe they don't have a website? Or didn't pay Google to advertise them? I don't know how it works
Robert: Hm, maybe, thanks Jess! I was really close to inviting Gemma to that new place
Jessica: For a date? Oh my, that'd have been disaster"

Nick: Yeah, thank God for that. But truthfully, I've had enough of these earthquakes. Sometimes I feel like moving.
Jerry: I know what you mean, but I've lived in FL my whole life.
Nick: That's the thing, I want to see more of the world.
Jerry: Maybe
Nick: Think of it, a place where you don't have to board up your house at least once per year :)
Jerry: A fantasy world :)
Nick: No, a reality. My brother lives in Chicago, and I am seriously thinking of selling this place and moving in with him for some time. Maybe I can even ask for a transfer at my work.
Jerry: Yeah, your company has many offices all over the world and Chicago's like their hub, isn't it?
Nick: Yeah, they have their HQ there. If I can get a transfer, I swear I'm selling my house and moving. Or at least rent it out.
Jerry: Well, I don't want to encourage you. Who else would I be able to hang out with? :)
Nick: <File_photo> Look at the damage done to my yard :-/
Jerry: Wow, mine's not that bad.
Nick: Well, the hurricane kind of veered west later on, so I think your area was spared the worst.
Jerry: Hmm...maybe. If you need any help fixing it up, I can help you out.
Nick: Yeah, that would be great. I was gonna call for some professional help, but then those companies are really expensive.
Jerry: Don't bother, they'll take a fortune. I have this weekend free, so you buy the beers and I can be there bright and early Sat.
Nick: Cool, hey thanks a lot, man.
Jerry: No problem. Do you want me to bring something to eat?
Nick: We can have burgers on the barbecue. I may have some in the freezer.
Jerry: Ok, just let me know if you need me to bring anything.

George: True. I can‚Äôt afford the plane tickets.
Jane: I understand, not your fault! 
George: Sorry!
Jane: It‚Äôs okay; I just want to get your thoughts on mom. Should we try to hire someone to look in on her daily? Move her laundry to the upstairs? What do you think?
George: I think we should definitely try to avoid having the laundry on a different floor or get a stair lift or something. Which is cheaper?
Jane: I think a stair lift is a few thousand, but so would a plumbing job and getting a stackable that would fit upstairs. About even, in other words. Not sure what she‚Äôll go for. Probably neither!
George: She might go for the lift then. Keeps everything pretty much the same.
Jane: True.
George: What about getting someone to check on her?
Jane: I was thinking the neighbor. She‚Äôs retired and I‚Äôd offer to pay her to pop in once a day and have coffee, keep her company. Can you help out with the cash?
George: Not really. I‚Äôm pretty strapped and need to save for a plane ticket back, apparently!
Jane: Okay, I‚Äôll see what I can figure out.
George: What did the doctor say?
Jane: She didn‚Äôt break anything, just a bad sprain where she tried to catch herself.
George: Thank God she didn‚Äôt hit her head!
Jane: I know!
George: Good thing you were dropping by anyway. How long did she lay there?
Jane: Not long, an hour or so. Long enough!
George: She must have been scared. I‚Äôll call her later. Do they let her have her phone?
Jane: Yes, but it may need to be charged. Call the hospital and ask for 2231.
George: Okay.

Lucy: I know. I just want to vomit. I cannot even look at this shit anymore.

Lucy: :((((
Ann: BTW. Adam asked me out yesterday. What do you think about him? I had an impression that you're not a fan.
Lucy: No, I'm not, being honest.
Ann: Why? Because he always says this slightly stupid jokes?
Lucy: The jokes are not a problem even. He seems very insincere and just a hustler.
Ann: What do you mean?
Lucy: Do you remember the last party at the university, when he was bartending? 
Ann: Sure, that was fun.
Lucy: Could be better. At some moment I gave him a note of 50 and didn't get my change. So I asked for it and he replied that there was no change now and I should come back later. That was already strange. I returned after 15 minutes and he gave me 10, instead of 45. I said it was not all, so he gave me another 10. I had to tell him something like ""listen Adam, I gave you 50, the drink was 5, you owe me 45"". Even after this he came back only with 30. I had to press him a few times, it was super unpleasant.
Ann: That's really strange.
Lucy: I know. It was quite late already. After midnight. I think he assumed people are drunk, have fun, and nobody would notice that something is wrong with money. Especially when your mate is bartending.
Ann: Possibly. But he's also quite well off, why would he do anything like this?
Lucy: I don't know. I'm just telling you what happened.
Ann: Right
Lucy: And you know, it's not really about money for me. It's about who this guy is.

Pauline: And I have to tell you that it's really dissapointing
Pauline: For example the catering case
Pauline: The restaurant owners decided that they won't open and when people responsible for organization convinced them, it turned out that it's really expensive
Pauline: Moreover when the conference was coming to an end, restaurant decided that the rest of the food that they knew they won't sell anymore will be given out for free
Pauline: So imagine that you bought pricy piece of cake and coffee and suddendly 3 hours later they give out for free remaining things
Stanley: A bit unfair
Pauline: And the presentations of lecturers lasted only 20 minutes each.
Stanley: Wow. That's quick.
Pauline: Definitely too little time. In 20 minutes they won't be able to even introduce their products :/
Stanley: On the other hand, you have to know what kind of mistakes are made while organizing such events. If for example you will ever take part in organizing a conference, you will be aware of things you should avoid.

Marianne: But why Canada? It's so cold
Tony: Have you ever been there at least
Ann: No, I haven't, but that's the best, something completely new
Marianne: I think you would like it
Marianne: it's American, but not too much
Tony: and European, but not too much
Marianne: true!
Tony: but you should go to Vancouver

Ann: I didn't know it's such a liveable city, they always talk about Vienna and Melbourne 
Tony: and Vancouver, I think this is the holy trinity of comfortable life on this planet
Marianne: But you would be so far from us...
Ann: Maybe I'll just do it for a while
Ann: And most of all we will see if I can find a job there
Ann: But I could basically anything
Tony: I feel I'm too old for that, but I envy you a bit
Ann: But you've done it already, with Paris I think
Tony: Yes, but it was in my 30s

13829267,"Anthony: Hello my dear Helen! After all these happy-new-year greeting it's time for a recap. Here is a bit of a pictorial review of my year (well holidays really) - interested?
Angela: Great to hear from you again and so soon. Sure I'm interested.
Anthony: Starting with kayaking in May, including Hetty, Ken, Joss (Hetty‚Äôs son) and Sarah on the team-sheet.
Anthony: 5 day‚Äôs kayaking, where we paddled from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, along the Caledonian Canal in Scotland. It is mainly Loch Ness and three smaller lochs, joined up by canal sections, and is about 65 miles long.
Angela: Ant the weather? Scottish?
Anthony: It was the most perfect weather ever (we have had that sort of a summer).
Anthony: <file_photo> and the most stunning countryside.
Anthony: <file_photo> The head of Loch Ness where we wild-camped in an idyllic bluebell glade. Yes this really is Scotland!
Anthony: <file_photo> Me being inert on Loch Lochy.
Anthony: <file_photo> And with Joss and Sarah.
Angela: Wait a sec!
Angela: I don't understand kayaking in these flimsy objects.
Anthony: They aren't flimsy having polyethylene hulls.
Anthony: And some photos from our sailing trip in The Hebrides:
Anthony: <file_photo>
Anthony: So my sailing trip was back to the Hebrides, but this time to the northern part. Again the weather and scenery were perfect.
Angela: Can't believe it! Looks absolutely stunning.
Anthony: In August I spent 23 days along the Silk Road, from Kyrgyzstan, into western China, then Takikistan and Uzbekistan:
Anthony: <file_photo>
Anthony: <file_photo> One night I woke up in my Yurt, to find this kitten snuggling up to me.
Angela: Looks as if you were about to take it along with you.
Angela: Did you sleep in yurts?!
Anthony: A marvellous trip through some amazing cities, and spectacular mountain scenery in hotels, guest houses, ‚Äúhome stays‚Äù, and camping in Yurts.
Anthony: <file_photo> And finally over Christmas in Morocco with Sarah and Zof.
Angela: Zof again? I wish you did!
Anthony: With Zof and her boyfriend plus Denis I had a week cycling on the Sahara side of the High Atlas mountains in Morocco. The cycling was a bit boring, but we went to some great places and had a great trip.
Angela: Very impressive. Thanks for sharing!!!"

Lucie: Let me know pls when you're online. I wish you a great time.
Papa: Hello Lucie, could you please take a snap of this invoice from RA Nunn? Or scan it and sent to me via email? It may be urgent.
Papa: Yes, if you could pay the GP bill, it would be very helpful. As for the chimney sweep, why don't you ask Ms Shottner, if he'd been there or not.

13830062,"William: Hello Hobbs! A new update on our whereabouts. Just moved over to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. Empty roads giving you a weird feeling. We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation as its address was like Marida, Caucel, Avenida 68, Puerta Sisal, Calle 31, Avenida Caucel 68, Calle 3/2419 B. After much asking around, as we don't have a navigation system here, and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house, which turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.
William: <file_photo>
William: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep, did some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan today and are looking forward to reconnoiter the area tomorrow.
William: <file_photo>
Hobbs: Hi there! Many thanks for the details. Caucel rings a bell with me. Is it to the west of the city itself? A fairly new development?
William: That's it. Brand new and still being developed. Following a wide and brand new avenida today, we ended up with this. <file_photo> And dense vegetation beyond!
Hobbs: Looks like Mexico to me. But they'll pick up the continuation once they needed it. Practically minded as they are. And how did you like the city itself?
William: We got stuck on the Plaza Mayor, this being Sunday. It was turned into a market square with stalls offering local food, craftsmanship products and household goods, surprising un-touristy. In front of Palacio del Gobierno, a supreme show of dancing in local costumes.
William: <file_photo>
Hobbs: Did you manage to get to the balcony of the Palacio on the first floor and get some photos from there?
William: But of course!
William: <file_photo>
William: Theresa tried to prevent me from trespassing but you know me. Even managed to get to the loo there!
Hobbs: Good boy! And how about the cathedral? Casa de Montejo? Is it still accessible or is it only a bank?
William: Both, and Theresa intends to visit the cathedral again to take some more photos. I didn't find it that impressive, apart from the west facade of course. A small part of Casa de Montejo on the ground floor is a museum now, interiors with period furniture plus a small modern art gallery, quite pleasant though over-airconditioned, but the rest is a bank, I think.
Hobbs: If I remember correctly they bought the building some time ago and financed its restoration. To have a good overview of the city, you should try a ride on an open double-decker bus.
William: Planned for a day to come. Tomorrow we want to go to Sisal and drive along the coast to Progresso.
Hobbs: You'd better stay in Sisal, enjoy the beach and absolutely try one of their fish restaurants. As far as I remember the road leading eastwards peters out after a few kms and you are nowhere.  Years back with my team we mapped the ruins of Xcopte temple east of the road but it took us a strenuous march and even worse kayaking. I don't think it's been made open to sightseeing. I'd give it a miss anyway, nothing spectacular.
William: Thanks for the tip! We are planning though to drive down and visit Uxmal. Is it worth it?
Hobbs: Absolutely! It is a must. Huge, well preserved, with a totally unique - oval - pyramid, el Piramide del Adivino. Plan one whole day for this site. It is exceptional. One of my favourites in this part of Yucatan.
William: We will! I'm developing a slight liking for Maya architecture :-)
Hobbs: I bet you are! Anyway please keep me posted about your travelling there.
William: Sure. Your tips are invaluable to us. You'll hear from us soon!"

Lorenzo: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it
Lorenzo: And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina
Pablo: Whatta hell are you two talking about??
Pablo: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf
Pablo: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight!
Luigi: Hahaha Pablito :D
Luigi: You follow UFC events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people
Pablo: Aight but those R people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing!
Pablo: He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard
Lorenzo: You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD
Pablo: Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense
Pablo: But anyway... Mayweather won, you've said that. And McGregor? Was he sharp?
Luigi: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds
Luigi: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again
Luigi: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :)
Pablo: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience!
Luigi: No doubt about it, bro
Lorenzo: But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit
Pablo: True
Lorenzo: So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? :)
Pablo: Duuuuuude
Pablo: Conor would destroy him, no doubt
Luigi: Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :)
Pablo: Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am
Lorenzo: Good old Pablo... I love your temperament you son of a bitch
Pablo: Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that
Luigi: Lol xD"

Stan: You don't say?
Cooper: Yeah, lately I've grown to like some of the new prog rock stuff.
Stan: I told you it's cool. Stuff like Periphery and Disperse is great stuff.

Mandy: Well, I didn't actually buy it, dad.
Roger: No? 
Mandy: I won it.
Roger: Really? 
Mandy: Yes. in the Company Christmas party.
Roger: How did that happen?
Mandy: We had a cheese tasting competition. One of our clients is Eurocheese, and the boss thought it was a good way to cement the business.
Roger: You had to guess the cheeses?
Mandy: That's right. Three rounds. In the first round everyone took part, there were ten pieces of cheese marked one to ten, and you could see them and write on your piece of paper what you thought they were. 
Roger: What happened then?
Mandy: The second round was just the best ten of the answers from round one. The cheeses were rarer so I don't think they wanted to give out too many pieces of them. Stuff like Wensleydale, Tilsiter. There were only five and I can't remember them all.
Roger: and what about the final round.
Mandy: That was the best three from the second round, with blindfolds on, up in the front. Three cheeses to guess with no clues.
Roger: And you got them all? 
Mandy: It was not so hard. I knew what cheeses they were selling hardest so it wasn't too difficult to second guess what would be in the final. Chevre, Port Salut, Stilton.
Roger: So you won first prize?
Mandy: No, the two runner ups got these stiltons for Christmas, I was one of them with Tracey from accounts. Dan won and got a whole cheeseboard.
Roger: Still, joint second is a very good achievement, isn't it?
Mandy: Yeah. Especially given the fact that I can stand the stuff and never eat it.
Roger: If you guessed them all, how come you didn't win first prize?
Mandy: Dan knew the full name of that chevre cheese. "

Ella: Uni's hard work (no changes there), but I really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is Microbiology (so all on bacteria), another is on the Biochemical Pathways to Metabolic Illnesses (basically diabetes and obesity) - so, pretty cool stuff :D
Ella: WHat about you? Are you having fun?
Matty: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays
Ella: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups?
Matty: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one?
Ella: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's  a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right?
Matty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it?
Matty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there
Ella: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what?
Matty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you
Matty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people
Ella: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people?
Matty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?
Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics

13731166,"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.

Jimmy: Always good ;) you?
Sammy: Fine, a bit of a mess here recently, but nothing really bad
Tom: I've been following the protests in France recently
Tom: but, honestly, I don't understand very well what it is all about.
Theo: it was motivated by rising fuel prises and high cost of living
Tom: Do you think it's populist?
Tom: That's what they always say in media
Theo: I'm not sure, they're demanding more justice, I can't see populists elements in it
Jimmy: I really don't like the word populism
Jimmy: I don't think it describes anything anymore
Theo: I read a Guardian article about it some times ago, they tried to built a definition of it
Jimmy: and how did they define it?
Theo: <file_other> ""Populism is usually described as a strategic approach that frames politics as a battle between the virtuous, ‚Äúordinary‚Äù masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite"".
Jimmy: Yes, but that's actually quite a lib-cons vision, because aren't we in a kind of struggle between an ""elite"" and ordinary people?
Jimmy: with all the tax evaders, corporations, growing inequalities? 
Theo: maybe you're right
Jimmy: it's not surprising that people want a change
Theo: The only stupid thing is that then they vote for Trump, Salvini and Orban
Jimmy: Exactly, so maybe we should call ""populism"" all the parties, politicians, movements that promise to address the inequalities and problems, but actually make them worse or focus on even less privileged groups (refugees, unemployed, immigrants, minorities) and blame them for the problems... which of course makes problems only worse
Theo: haha, that's a much better definition than that of the guardian, I think
Jimmy: hahah, thanks"

Tina: The first and the most difficult part is to prepare the dough
Mona: Actually I've got some experience with making the dough
Mona: I've done that many times before for my mom
Tina: So you know the basics. But the pizza dough is specific
Tina: You'll need: 250 grams of wheat flour, 150 ml of warm water, 2 spoons of olive oil, 4 grams of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt and the same amount of sugar
Tina: You can also add 2 spoons of mixed herbs to that, but it's optional
Mona: Good cuz I have everything besides the herbs!
Tina: Awesome, so now the instruction. Ready?
Mona: Ready!
Tina: Pour the flour and yeast to a big bowl and mix them well
Tina: Now add the olive, sugar and salt and mix again
Tina: Now, while kneading the dough you need to add water little by little, until you get, say, a ball of dough
Mona: Got it! I guess I should leave it for some time to rise, right?
Tina: Exactly. Half an hour should be fine
Tina: Use this time to prepare all ingredients that you'd like to put on pizza
Mona: Olives, salami, onion, chicken... Yummy!
Tina: Ok, now smooth the baking sheet with a bit of oil and form the dough on it
Mona: Done
Tina: Time for tomato sauce and all the ingredients you've prepared.
Tina: Did I tell you to preheat the oven to 220 degrees? If not, do it now
Tina: Put your pizza in the oven and wait more less 20 minutes. Check how's the baking going from time to time, maybe you'll have to get it out of a bit earlier

Dan: She is good, doing well. She gave birth to a baby girl yesterday.
Mary: Congrats! That is a great news.
Dan: The doctor has advised her rest for a week. It was cesarean.
Mary: Oh I see. Hope there is no complications.
Dan: No, nothing much, just that she needs to rest till the stitches are removed.
Mary: Now that you both have become new parents you will be finding it difficult to cope up with the night‚Äôs sleep. Don‚Äôt you?
Dan: I believe it is quite normal with a newborn baby.
Mary: Yes, I had to undergo this when my elder child was born.
Dan: You have 2 kids, right?
Mary: Yes.
Dan: Hope that must have been a tough time for you guys.
Mary: It was, initially. But we got through it gradually. Now, I rarely sleep through night.

13828490,"Frannie: Hi Jim
Jim: Oh, hi Fran
Frannie: I guess you're as horrified by tomorrow's exam as I am
Jim: I guess so too
Frannie: I didn't really understand the part about substrata and superstrata
Jim: It's easy actually, plus there is a good Wikipedia page about them XD
Frannie: I trust your notes from class more than Wiki
Jim: And rightly so! Anyway
Frannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)
Jim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language
Frannie: Ok
Jim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one
Frannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?
Jim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on
Frannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?
Jim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries
Frannie: Ok
Jim: I have a question too
Frannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes
Jim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November
Frannie: Ok
Jim: So... what was exactly the story with the name ""Mediolanum""?
Frannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant ""p"" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for ""father"" was ""athir"" (vs. ""pater"" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars ""Mediolanum"" came from ""medio-"" and ""planum"" because there is no ""p"", so it's basically ""in the middle of the plane"".
Jim: Ok! Thanks
Frannie: You're more than welcome, you helped me too
Jim: ;)
Frannie: Good luck for tomorrow!
Jim: Godspeed!"

Haley: True that
Nick: So what did you sacrifice?
Haley: Arcadia Bay.
Nick: Srsly?? I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.
Haley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? 
Nick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.
Haley: obviously :P
Haley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players
Nick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?
Haley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.
Nick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?
Haley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.
Nick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.
Haley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?
Nick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.
Haley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.
Nick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.
Haley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.
Nick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D
Haley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.
Nick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P"

13682417-1,"Tim: Good evening Peter, I'd hate to bother you with a call at that unearthly time but I must ask you something that might be urgent but not before tomorrow morning. My sister had just taken a bad fall in the bathroom hitting her L lower rib cage against an edge of a bathtub and is experiencing general pain. She doesn't think she's broken anything. Would you think it might be something demanding medical attention?
Peter: Good evening Tim, I'm still in bed reading, Emma is asleep, so I'll stick to writing. Firstly, sorry to hear that but don't worry. If she can still move and talk, it can't be too bad. She doesn't spit blood, does she?
Tim: No.
Peter: Is the impacted area swollen?
Tim: No.
Peter: BTW when did it happen?
Tim: Not more than an hour ago.
Peter: Is she alone? Sorry I mean immediate help if her condition deteriorated.
Tim: She lives alone. Her next door neighbours are just across the yard but I don't think they would be much help, being old themselves.
Peter: Do you think she'll be capable of phoning in case of an urgent need?
Tim: I should think so. Well, she texted me after the accident.
Peter: While you talked to her, was she lucid?
Tim: We couldn't talk because of my wife and the baby in the same room. She also preferred to write, since, as I suppose, it was less painful that talking. And yes ‚Äì she was absolutely lucid.
Peter: Of course I cannot say anything definite without examining her but judging by the symptoms you've described I'd tend to say that it's just soreness due to the impact of the fall. But she has to observe her body.
Tim: Exactly what I told her! Should she see a doctor?
Peter: She might if she feels worse. What she may need, however, are painkillers. Tell your sister not to hesitate to take painkillers. Even strong ones. For that she may need a prescription.
Tim: Will they advise me at the drugstore when I describe the case? Anything over the counter?
Peter: If you're going to get them for her, take IBU-ratiopharm 400 g, 20 pills, and 10 pills of the same but 600 g. She may want to start with the stronger one.
Peter: Yes, they're available over the counter.
Tim: It's so generous of you to let me have all this advice at this late hour. I really appreciate it, Peter. Thank you very much.
Peter: Really nothing to thank for. Glad I could help. Let me know how she's doing.
Tim: I will. Thank you again. And good night.
Peter: Good night, Tim."

Mike: it's this Saturday, right?
John: right. and we should decide on decorations, the present and all. Do we make it a theme party?
Rachel: she might like that.
John: Any ideas for the theme?
Mike: she likes anime
Rachel: omg no
John: I agree this might be too much
Mike: any better ideas then?
Rachel: I mean I guess we could handle the anime, but we have to think about other guests - they might not be able to dress up for that and not everyone loves anime.
John: how about gothic/horror?
Rachel: like a Halloween party? :P
Mike: yeah, that's just Halloween, something more original maybe?
Rachel: Generic fantasy - like knights and wizards
John: tough costumes
Rachel: but intentionally lame :P like ""adventure! on a budget."" we'll just make it all look poor - it's gonna be fun and easy to make as we all kinda suck at crafting
Tom: hey
Tom: yeah, I'm with the lame fantasy idea
John: Laura might like it
Rachel: I can be take care of the decorations
Mike: you're gonna make a spreadsheet, aren't you?
Rachel: you bet
Tom: I can cook something. What budget do we have?

Heather: No, but I heard that you can buy them from Costco for like 40 per ticket.
Izzy: Ok, I'll go online and let you know. I just hope it doesn't rain. When it rains, they usually close down the rides.

Tom: Actually, there are two things. First of all, my wife and I are looking for a flat. At the same time we want to sell our old flat.
Diana: I understand. Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?
Tom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?
Diana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.
Tom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.
Diana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.
Tom: Thank you! This is a great advice!
Tom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.
Diana: How many rooms are you looking for?
Tom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.
Diana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?
Tom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.
Diana: Thank you. What's your current budget?
Tom: We were thinking about ¬£400 000. Would it be possible?
Diana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?
Tom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.
Diana: How much are you aiming for?
Tom: At least ¬£300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.
Diana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you.
Tom: That would be perfect!

Alice: We both don't like museums that much, and he is kinda shy to meet people.
Emma: In that case it's okay. I understand. But I already asked my husband if he could make time and hang around together.
Emma: Since it was you who suggested this plan to spend time together, I thought it was already fixed. 
Emma: Now I should tell him that it wasn't a fixed plan, which WOULD HAVE BEEN much easier if you had asked your future-to-be boy friend first.
Alice: Really? I thought it wasn't the fixed plan. 
Alice: Coming to think about him again, I was not sure if t would be alright to introduce him somebody yet since I  also don't know about him that much yet.
Alice: But I didn't take it into account the possibility it could sound like a clear plan to you and I didn't think that way. Sorry once more. 
Emma: Sorry as well if I reacted too sensitively.
Alice: No. You and your husband both are not students and you must be much busier than I am.
Alice: I thought only in my point of view. Sorry.
Emma: Thank for understanding my point of view. It is necessary for us to know about our tendencies in our personalities and this is good thing we could get to know about the different point of view.
Alice: Yes. I think so too. Next time I will be more careful. 
Alice: But what about your weekend plan? Is it okay?

Gillian: oh. don't even get me started...
Brad: Basically not good :P
Gillian: Those workers are fucking worst...
Brad: Workers are workers, they're ok, but the guy we hired - their boss - he's just impossible to work with.
Gillian: I literally hate this guy.
Brian: What's so bad about him? 
Gillian: First of all, when we hired him he told us it'll take ""about 3 weeks"" to get this renocvation done. He had done half of it by the third week. 
Brad: It's been almost 2 months now and they MIGHT be nearing the end
Gillian: the worst part is that he knows we're not gonna ditch him, because it's so hard to get a renovation crew. Most of them are available like two months from now and we need to move in fast.
Brad: We're sort of desperate and he knows that, so he takes his sweet time.
Brian: I'm sorry to hear that
Gillian: and he has a really condescending attitude and treats us like morons.
Gillian: especially me, because I'm a woman
Brad: you don't know that for sure
Gillian: yes I do. Basically, we don't understand all the technicalities of this renovation so he can get away with a lot of things. I try to fact-check him sometimes, but he'll just brush it off, cause he knows better.
Brad: We're staying at Gillian's sister's apartment and I feel we really overstay our welcome. 
Gillian: I mean, she's my sis, she's gonna host us as long as we need and doesn't say anything, but I feel she'd like to have more space for herself. 
Brian: I get that. I hope they finish soon. 
Gillian: I'm praying for it every day :/ 
Brad: When they're done we're going to write them a terrible review on the web.
Gillian: Seriously, never go to Ferguson Renovations. Ever."

Sophie: There is little honest and altruistic about her. She has enough money but never thought about giving out the book to those men and women who suffered the same.
Robert: Sophie Why would they want to read it?
Msty:  Never liked her something I did not know what

Kevin: No, I still need to improve my skills a bit to feel safer and more confident. Are you in Paris? Is Paris burning?
Henry: Yes :D I arrived and saw a room and am not sure about it.
Kevin: Oh
Henry: This is why I wanted to ask you.
Kevin: Why?
Henry: for life advice!
Kevin: tell me
Henry: It's an OK-ish room, but a bit dark with window to a courtyard. In winter it can be a bit depressing.
Kevin: Light is important. Is it expensive?
Henry: Paris is super expensive. Usually you pay 800 euro for a room, this one is 400 only.
Kevin: Any other problems with the room?
Henry: Yes, I have to go outside the apartment to get to the toilette.
Kevin: Oh, this is literally pretty shitty. But for this price...
Henry: I think the question is: Am I still a student looking for a good deal and a quick solution? Or am I a serious person, wanting a serious room, even if a little bit more expensive and difficult. 
Kevin: Is the location at least good?
Henry: It is not in the city centre, but OK. It is the area I can expect, I mean more central is really unrealistic. 
Kevin: I would see some other options before the final decision. You have just arrived, after all.
Henry: You are right. I am just so lazy. But you are very right, unfortunately. "

Mia: Thanks Luca :) Enjoy Florence!! Do you know what you wanna see?
Luca: I am hoping to see the state of David because I love art and museums. Maybe I'll get to see Rome too.
Luca: Have you ever been to Italy?
Mia: I have actually :D I went to Rome for a weekend and went to mass at the Vatican when the Pope was there :) That was pretty cool

Storm: Just joined. I'm enjoying the speech by President Marcon. I pray ppl in my country are listening. I hope our current ruler is listening. We are on very thin ice over here in the US. I don't think ppl truly understand the value of the past.
Patte: Macron's speech (and I am not a particular fan of his)
Laura: Brian the musical performances.
Denis: The view from the Arc down the Champs. Seeing the lettering on the monument, and the students reading the letters of soldiers.
Angie: Brian when he said nationalism was the opposite of patriotism. So true and I wish others would realize it.
Anne: ""Nationalism is the betrayal of patriotism "" Macron, 11/11/2018 Love it!
Margaret: My daughter went to a local fair in Sydney today and all the hundreds attending fell silent at 11am. Very moving!
Denis:  Its a Beautiful moment in the history of the world
Jan: Unfortunate that when a letter by Remarque was being read in German, both CNN and BBC reporters starting talking about something else.
Laura: I am so sorry for every Country's loss of friends, family, neighbors and Citizens. So many attending are emotional. My heart and prayers go out to all of them.üò™
Tom: in fact African leaders shouldn't have been invited because they have failed Africa and the world as a whole
Patte: Tom you don't understand the global capital. Europe is a partner to the demise of Africa. African leaders have colluded with global capital. go read up on Togo politics.
Destiny: There's no single benefit after war, Sincere peace is the ultimate. Therefore I urge the whole world to embrace peace.
Angie: Agree!
Larry: War is what comes when people give up on peaceful solutions . Ideas are what keep us from war. Love and Trust are always better than Fear and Doubt.
Larry:  Today is Veterans Day in the US.  We honor everyone‚Äôs service to their respective countries 
Peter:  What about the killings that are happening right now because of you and your allies, around the world or the middle east to be precise.
Kafuka: exactly my thoughts.

Jill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?
Doris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.

Doris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.
Jill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?
Doris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!

Susan: why so?
Bill: away from the sea. like in the very middle of the country. No beaches. 
Susan: why would you go to Italy and not have a beach?
Bill: we wanted to be away from the crowds. place had a pool and it was drivable everywhere interesing. Like a couple of hours to florence, rome, an hour to the beach if you needed to.
Susan: pool would make up for much, true. but Italy in august?
Bill: hot as hell, but with the pool and AC it was nice. and full wine season. 
Susan: we would be going with the whole lot, the 4 of us and the dogs. do they take pets? did you take Sparky?
Bill: yup. no problem with the dogs, although you have to be careful not to let the dogs roam around the pool. they got very angry once, when we just let Sparky out and he jumped the fence. But yours are tiny. Fat, but tiny.
Susan: cannot imagine them jumping the fence. Any fence. they have trouble to get on the couch. 
Susan: I keep telling the kids not to overfeed the dogs, but you know how they are, as soon as I turn around...
Bill: like you don't give them treats at the table :P
Susan: shut up!
Bill: anyhoo, we drove, with sparky and the kids, much cheaper. And you need the car when you're there. It's like this little village in the middle of countryside. vinyards and olive trees. and crickets.
Susan: drive there? how long?
Bill: two days, we drove through Germany and Austria. Made an overnight in the Alps. 8 hours to Austria then like 6 hours to the place in Italy. 
Susan: seems not that bad. 
Bill: wasn't. and the place being so cheap we could afford three weeks... 
Bill: it was like half the price of a hotel. We cooked ourselves or went out for dinner. nice little italian restaurants, great food. we even found a 2-star one in some little village in the middle of nowhere, can you imagine?
Susan: oh, nice. 
Susan: It seems like a good deal. I'll talk to the hubby. send me the details, okay?
Bill: will do. phone number - they speak english, and e-mail. better to e-mail them the owner responds on the evenings, during the day he's in the field with the vines and stuff.

Liam: OK so fly to Vietnam in winter, it can be dirt cheap, and in summer to Cuba. It's always cheap.

Tress: How lovely for you! What's Vosges? Pardon my ZA ignorance!
Doris: :)) Most Europeans wouldn't know either. A small mountain range, up to 1500 m, in western France, just across the border from us.
Doris: Am with a lady friend of mine, German. A bit of hiking in the area but staying in one place. She's got her big dog with her and the beast is just divine.
Tress: Aren't you so lucky to be able to walk as women alone in parts of Europe? This is unheard of here.
Doris: This freedom of movement, also as a woman alone, driving or walking, city or countryside, this is a measure of a quality of life I take for granted in Europe. As much as I love being in ZA, I find it so difficult to cope with such restrictions. I love ZA dearly but I couldn't live there.
Tress: I assure you I hate it as much as you do but it's part and parcel of my existence, so I take THIS for granted.
Doris: Sure enough. When over there, I accept it too and adjust accordingly but in the back of my mind there's this feeling of discomfort.
Tress: What's your accommodation like? I've never been to France even.
Doris: Oh it's very very untypical. Here the link:
Doris: A group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it. And of paying guests! Everything fanatically organic, environmentally friendly and sustainable. No mobile phones, no cigarettes, no non-biodegradable products...
Tress: Sounds a tough regime! Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)
Doris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till! You just take what you need and leave the money in the till.
Tress: No!!! Can you imagine anything like that in Khayelitsha?!
Doris: May be more in Khayelitsha that in a mixed race area?
Tress: Nowhere in this wretched country. Never.
Tress: Look what's been happening here. It's a clip from our local paper: <file_photo>
Doris: Oh no! Horrible HORRIBLE
Tress: Our daily news... So enjoy your European paradise Doris!
Doris: It rams it home how lucky we are here. Travelling freely from country to country, meeting freely whoever and wherever. No border controls. 
Tress: But different languages! I found it so confusing when we flew from England to Amsterdam, then on to Frankfurt and to Rome in the end.
Doris: But everyone speaks English. More or less.
Tress: But we two, speaking only English, felt a bit limited. Or it's just our lack of experience in travelling. So much unlike you!
Doris: Oh well... Anyway it's France now in a Dutch colony and there are at least 3 language in the air. It is Europe as well, I guess.

Paola: It‚Äôs about this Serbian family just after the war in Yugoslavia. It‚Äôs been a hist for a few years now and I‚Äôm happy to see they‚Äôre back on stage this season as well
Paola: I‚Äôve seen the play a few years ago and actually wrote a review of it, but would be happy to go with you and know what you think of it
Austin: Oh wow that sounds great! Ofc I wanna go

Paola: The theatre is called El Rinc√≥n de S√°nchez <othre_file>
Paola: We can meet there
Austin: Sounds good. Nicola, would you like to go together? These long, lonely journeys on the bus are soooo boring
Nicola: Ha ha, sure, I bet we can have a nice chat, especially if we actually walk a little bit. I‚Äôd suggest meeting at the entrance to the Alto Palermo shopping mall and walking from there
Austin: Can I ask if it‚Äôs safe? üôä
Nicola: Yeah, I do think so

Nicola: I‚Äôll be coming straight from work so it sounds like the perfect plan
Nicola: What do we have nearby
Austin: There‚Äôs actually this place which sells empanadas which are not that bad just where we‚Äôre meeting. Not a grand dinner but enough for me
Nicola: Yer, that would do. Let‚Äôs just meet at 7:15 in case there are many people in the line or you happen to prefer to eat the empanadas while standing rather than walking üòπ
Austin: Lol sounds perfect
Paola: I‚Äôll see you at the theatre then. There‚Äôs nowhere to wait outside, so I‚Äôll be waiting for you in the hall if that‚Äôs ok
Austin: Totally
Paola: See you soon then
Nicola: Yep. Byeeee!"

Ashton: yeah, it seems like it never stops

Ashton: tempering
Ashton: again...
Lucas: seems like a recurring theme with them
Ashton: most of the times it's blown out of proportions
Lucas: so what happened?
Lucas: I'm not really up to speed
Ashton: Magic held a press meeting and told the reporters that Simmons contacted him for potential mentoring next summer
Lucas: that's it?
Ashton: well apparently Philly's GM didn't allow it and now NBA is investigating
Lucas: does seem like it's blown out of proportions like you said
Ashton: they probably still have all the drama with George and Davis in mind
Ashton: and are playing it safe
Lucas: if that continues Magic won't be able to talk to anyone outside the Lakers organization
Ashton: maybe it would be safer for him this way
Ashton: I don't think other franchises are happy with him and James' agent getting involved with all this
Lucas: I'm sure it happens with other GMs as well
Lucas: they're just not under such a scrutiny
Ashton: that's what you get when you're Magic
Ashton: too bad it doesn't help the team
Ashton: this season is pretty disappointing
Lucas: yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they'll miss the playoffs again
Ashton: maybe things will be better after the All-Star Weekend

Olivier: Right now, not really, I'm having a meeting. What happened?
Ian: I asked her to marry me. Not a real marriage, but just to preserve my rights in Italy after Brexit.
Olivier: I see.
Ian: As you can imagine, she refused.
Olivier: I am sorry. But why actually?
Ian: Hard to say. There is no need to be angry, no is no, she has the right to say no.
Olivier: yes, she does...
Ian: I think she is generally panicked, like afraid of the divorce proceedings and she doesn't feel entirely entitled since she believes to be ""a fake Italian"".
Olivier: Because she was born in Romania?
Ian: Exactly. It's completely ridiculous, before going to the US she even called the embassy to ask if the same procedure applies to her as ""a fake Italian"". She thinks to be a kind of a second class citizen.
Olivier: Quite stupid.
Ian: Very!
Olivier: But this is how it is.
Ian: She talked some rubbish afterwards, like we have to try other options etc., see what is possible.
Olivier: Are there any other options?
Ian: All of them are more complicated, if there are any at all. 
Olivier: I see.
Ian: But the truth is that I feel alone now with my problems, that I cannot rely on her.
Olivier: it's a sad ascertainment.
Ian: I am not going to ask her for anything big any more.

Gabriel: <file_other>
Isabella: that's quite amazing
Nate: finally, he really should be impeached, such a disgrace for America
Isabella: I agree, although I'm not sure it wouldn't be counterproductive 
Nate: what do you mean?
Isabella: that his voters don't behave rationally, they are people believing in strange conspiracy theories, full of hatred etc.
Nate: sure, but why doesn't matter?
Isabella: I'm just afraid that as soon as the impeachment procedure starts, they would only consolidate around him claiming that it's a huge conspiracy against ""American people""
Isabella: and if he was impeached they would keep believing that he was stoped from making America great again by some evil people
Nate: I get your point
Gabriel: I am unfortunately afraid of it as well
Gabriel: but it means that we have to wait till he really destroys this country completely, so the majority would be convinced he is evil or at least incompetent
Nate: but it may be too late then, he's not only destroying this country but the whole planet
Nate: think about the Paris Agreement
Isabella: right, very sad
Isabella: ok, there is some hope that the impeachment procedures would be conducted thoroughly presenting to the public all malpractices of this administration
Isabella: especially the Russian story may be appealing to the conservative mind
Gabriel: right, but as said - there are too many good reasons
Isabella: but for that to happen we really need to convince some republicans and media
Gabriel: and there is a question - who after Trump? According to the constitution I believe Pence should become the president
Gabriel: and he's a real bigot, arguably worse then demoralised Trump, who after all doesn't care about most of the things apart from his ego
Isabella: Yes, the moron Pence as president! this would be the end of the world as we know it"

Anna: It's a marvellous idea!
Michael: How does it work?
Derek: You draw the person for whom you're going to buy a gift.
Patricia: It's so cool! Please do it! Keep in mind that it must be a secret who everyone gets!
Michael: Oh, ok
Derek: Patricia's right. It's more fun when we don't tell each other who've got
Anna: Are we organising it just for our team or the whole department?
Derek: I don't know. I thought the department may be more fun, but then we don't know each other that well, so it may be quite troublesome to buy a right gift
Patricia: Yeah, but the point of Secret Santa is not buying precisely what the other person wants, but just having a bit of fun
Michael: I think we should stick to our team. There's the right number and I think 20 is enough
Anna: Hm, you may be right.
Derek: Ok, so now - price range. What do you reckon?
Patricia: 30?
Michael: It's quite a lot...
Patricia: Well, can you buy a decent gift for less than that? I'm not talking about buying someone a candle...
Anna: Hahaha, please guys don't buy each others candles...
Derek: Linda from HR loves candles
Patricia: Oh course she does
Michael: Can we make it 20 then?

Derek: Yeah...
Jack: I like Inglorious Basterds a lot, not a huge fan of his work as a whole but I've seen all of his movies and they were all at least decent.
Heather: Oh come on, The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece!
Derek: I haven't seen that one yet. But Django Unchained wasn't bad... a little too long, probably.
Jack: I liked them both, but I agree on the length of that one.

Anne: It's called That Sugar Film, you really should watch it
Becky: I watched Rotten on Netflix and didn't like, I don't argue it's not true, but sounds a bit too hysterical for me
Mike: I've seen it and I think it's great
Anne: But to think about the food and how we eat, what we eat, terrible, I'm really shaken up
Anne: Especially as the guy was eating - healthy food?
Frank: Well, actually he wasn't eating healthy, he was eating what media called healthy or light
Anne: I don't get how people can eat like this
Mike: But don't you?
Anne: I'm not drinking this much fizzy drinks like Mountain Dew and such
Mike: Yes, but you eat a lot of cereals
Becky: Hm, I need to watch it, but from what you're saying it doesn't strike me as something revolutionary - sugar is bad for you, do you need to watch a film to know it?
Frank: I think the terrifying part is how the food industry is lying to us, producing food that's supposed to help us be healthy and fit, but is actually getting us diabetes
Mike: Told you long time ago that you should read labels, every single time
Anne: Not everyone has time for that
Becky: Really? It doesn't take that much time

Jane: They were flying with Ryanair. Fiona said they were crazy tired and almost missed their boarding, but were admitted eventually. They followed the crowd and ended up in a wrong queue. It was an early morning flight, I think the flight attendant was simply tired and missed that tiny detail that they were flying to Manchester, not Madrid
Fred: This is crazy. What are they going to do?

Jane: Well, far far away as I said ;) Remember the guy I told you about? The traveller? He was telling me all about Cuba and Mexico, it sounded really cool.
Patricia: Isn't it a bit dangerous?...

Patricia: Ok, sounds fine. Never been on one, but happy to discover something new :)
Jane: I've been to a few and I think it's great if you don't have a lot of time and want to see a lot.

Jane: How about Vietnam or Thailand? We could look into both options.
Patricia: Been to Thailand, but wouldn't mind coming back, the food <3
Jane: :D hahahaha. Honestly can't decide. There's that one really cool trip to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

Jane: So it kind of sounds Asia it is :D God, already excited <3
Patricia: hahahaha, so it does! When could you get any time off? August is off limits for me and probably not the best month to go there.
Jane: I know, July then? It may be cheaper, because no one wants to go there in the summer :D
Patricia: Quite true, July sounds fine for me. Gotta go tell my boss I need a time off and ready to go!

Alan: That's right. I have been trying different combinations of rice, fish and fruit to make sweeter versions of some traditional sushi specials.
Rob: You have already tried making these sushi?
Alan: Yes, I've got about twelve different recipes for maki and nigiri featuring slices of pear or guava alongside the other elements. Less fish, and not every fish seems to like it.
Rob: OK, well you could try it. Take a stall in the middle of a mall corridor, get a certificate for HACCP and see if it takes off.
Alan: But it's all oing to cost quite a lot of capital outlay. I reckoned about 30,000 dollars to get going and I can only put in ten. Would you be interested in lending me some start-up capital?
Rob: If you can find 20 people to put in a thousand each, then I'll be one. How about that?
Alan: I have done a business plan and the possible upside if it catches on is tremendous
Rob: What's the  margin and the volume of sales you reckon you can get off one stall?
Alan: I reckon it's going to be about a thousand dollars in gross profit every day, once it gets going. And that's conservative.
Rob: Well, send me the numbers over. I might stretch to 5,000 if it's really convincing. But no abandoning it when you get bored like you did with the camper van renovation business
Alan: well that business was just a hobby. It was never going to make much money.

Kristel: So first of all, how to make a group? When I try to do it on the room plan, it says I can book the maximum of 5 tickets.
Jake: Before you go there, you need to choose a type of tickets, there look for Multiple Tickets/Groups.
Kristel: Okay, thank you, that‚Äôs clear. Another problem: when will I see the discount for groups?
Jake: You don‚Äôt have to do anything, after choosing a type and seats, the system will provide you with the amount to pay, showing how much it was discounted (depending on the number of people).
Kristel: What are the payment options?
Jake: Credit card, online transfer and PayPal.
Kristel: Which of them is the fastest?
Jake: PayPal of course, the longest is online transfer because it needs to be confirmed.
Kristel: Can I pay later, before the show?
Jake: The payment screen shows the amount and additionally the amount you need to pay to secure the places (it‚Äôs one third of the overall price).

Anna: I must tell you I feel really motivated. It's been only a month, but I really want to keep it going.
Mary: I understand, I've been through it and it can be a bumpy road, but it's worth it.
Anna: Have you eaten any meat since you decided to become a vegetarian?
Mary: Unfortunately yes, as I said - bumpy road ;) What's important is to keep going. I once had some dumplings with meat and chicken broth.
Anna: Weren't you tempted to go back then?
Mary: No, not really. I had meat mostly when I couldn't have anything else and I was really hungry. Funny enough, I've been craving those dumplings, but felt absolutely awful after having them.
Mary: The farther you go, the less you want to eat meat. At least in my case.
Anna: I can imagine. Surprisingly I don't find it as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I still eat fish though.
Mary: I'm trying to become vegan, but THIS is hard, really. I like dairy, love butter, eggs...
Anna: Oh yes, life without cheesecake? OR PIZZA?!
Mary: My thoughts exactly. Well, it's doable, but at what cost. Don't have enough time to grind everything for hours.
Anna: Are you taking any supplements? My GP is going nuts over the news and is trying to scare me that I will ruin my health.
Mary: I know those kind of doctors, don't worry, you'll be perfectly fine ;)
Mary: I take supplements, especially in the winter as we don't have so many fresh veggies to choose from.
Anna: What would you recommend? I wanted to ask my GP, but judging on her general approach...
Mary: I highly recommend chlorella (pills), vitamin B12 and D3. Basically everything that has proteins and helps you absorb them.
Anna: Thank you so much!
Anna: It really feels like a new journey, so excited! :)
Mary: You need to come over so I can show you some recipes! And remember - if you have any doubts, problems, you can always ask me, I'll do my best to help :)"

Carl: Well, not so great, did you know Wendy was very ill?
Kevin: No! What's the matter.
Carl: Well, it's liver cancer, terminal, I'm afraid.
Kevin: Christ man! I'm so sorry, I had no idea.
Carl: Well, it's only been about 3 months. When we worked on the Green Acres site last year, she was still perfectly healthy.
Kevin: Yeah, that was only last summer. What happened? (if you don't mind me asking.)
Carl: Well, we went on hols last September and she had problems with her stomach, bloating, pain and such, then a bit of bleeding. Saw the consultant and she said a tumour in the bowel had spread to the liver. That was only November and here we are in February with her in hospital.
Kevin: Shit, man! That's tough. I'm so sorry. How is she really?
Carl: Well, she knows it's bad, but she's in denial a bit. She is so relaxed in the hospital, in discomfort, but not any real pain. They are total stars there.
Kevin: I'll tell Bernadette about it, remember that works do last year? They really got on well, she'll be so concerned.
Carl: She has meditation classes as well, which she finds marvellous. They are talking about her moving to the hospice for better therapy and care, she won't have more than a few weeks left now.
Kevin: Oh, mate, that's brutal. You OK?
Carl: Well, I'm thinking of Wendy mostly, she is coping so well. Course, I'm tired, only go into work in the mornings now, spend 1 to 9pm with Wendy, kids have been there a lot too, girls from the office, my sister in law has been brilliant. People just love Wendy.
Kevin: Maybe me and Bernie will pop in, do you think she'd remember us?
Carl: Yes, she knew you and me were friends and she did like Bernie too. Come down tomorrow, mate. Takes a bit of pressure off me too.
Kevin: Yeah, we'll do that, what time is visiting?
Carl: 7 to 9, I can come for longer cos I'm her husband.
Kevin: What shall we bring her?
Carl: Oh, she likes oranges and grapes, though she doesn't eat much now, maybe some books or magazines?
Kevin: OK, well see you there, oh yes, which ward is it?
Carl: It's Aneurin Bevan Ward on the 2nd floor, just ask at reception.

Mel: Tell they u <3 them and what u feel.
Vicki: Maybe try talking to them separately? With ur mom first and then dad?

Mel: And when with dad?
Alex: Probably a couple hours l8r. Mom usually goes to sleep early, but dad watches TV until like 1 am

Alex: Usually about school, weekend plans and doing things together. 
Vicki: Perfect. Start with school. Parents usually listen when there's school involved.
Mel: Yeah. My listen very carefully. Especially when I tell them I got an F in a test and need them to sign it. 
Alex: I'll do that. And what next? Help! I'm clueless!
Vicki: When u tell them about school, casually tell them u've heard them shouting and what u heard.
Mel: But don't rush it. They'll know what's coming. 
Alex: Thanks, girls. I ou1.
Mel: Hang in there. 
Vicki: Yeah, tell us l8r what happened."

Merve: I asked a person who is year above us.
Rohit: I applied, but can't even see those classes on my online schedule...

Merve: I am waiting to ask Monika now
Rohit: I am at the counter to submit the application for the same
Efehan: And I have emailed the professors to resign from those classes. One of them said ok, the other one didn't understand the issue and invited me to his class.
Maria: Ahahaha. He probably barely speaks English. Merve, let us know what she says
Aga: But why do we need to chase them around for a signature if we declared it online...
Bartek: You need to write an email to IT support, for those subjects not appearing
Maria: Hahaha
Bartek: They will fix it :)
Aga: But there is a serious problem with getting rid of those subjects. The Dean said no to us, even though we have a permission from all professors to leave.
Efehan: Very serious indeed...
Aga: But it is their fault for confusing us with the declaration in June... And the Dean didn't say why, he just said NO
Efehan: As far as I know, the Dean is at some conference until next week. Let's chill for now and try to talk to him when he comes back

Martha: Look, do you really want your daughter to look like a tiny drag queen?
Sara: Ok, this is horrible, fair enough, but maybe a little bit?

Regina: Well, imagine you have a clean, white piece of material. Like table linen, right?
Eric: Ok.
Regina: U imagine something you want to draw on it and then take a pencil and draw it.
Eric: Bt that's destroying it!
Regina: Not so fast! After you've finished with the drawing you take some fibre and threads and start embroidering!
Eric: And that's how you get a nice pattern on table linen?
Regina: Ofc. Sure, you can buy something machine-made, but making ur own is far more satisfying!
Eric: I'm quite sure it is. So how long does it take you?
Regina: Depends on the size and material.
Eric: Well, usually. Nothing special.
Regina: More or less 3 months.
Eric: 3 months?!
Regina: Yeah. If I had more time, probably faster, bt u know work, friends, housework and stuff.

Bo: That might take a while. 
Steve: I'm listening. 
Bo: in general it was ok and i don't regret going, but there's a lot of things to work on. Like logistics - there was just chaos at every step before the larp - we didn't know where to go for accreditation, the organizers contradicted themselves several times
Steve: sounds bad
Bo: and there was a several hour delay at the beginning 
Steve: not encouraging
Bo: Yeah, but once it started it got better. You have to give it to them they really put a lot of effort in the props, the set and the costumes for npcs
Steve: any pictures?
Bo: I have several hundred actually, but I have to sift through them, so I'm just gonna upload them in a couple of days 
Steve: ok
Bo: and other players where generally good. Made a couple of friends there actually 
Steve: nice, do they larp outside their area? Maybe they could come to us sometime. We need some fresh blood. 
Bo: yeah, they're definitely interested and I'm pretty sure they have no problem traveling across the country for larps. 
Steve: great to hear
Bo: yeah, anyway there was also a group of orcs - I think they all new each other beforehand - and they were getting shit-faced every night, making lewd comments to girls and generally being assholes to everyone. 
Steve: shit, did you tell the organizers? 
Bo: yeah, I did, quite a few times, and they supposedly talked to them, but it didn't help at all 
Steve: too bad
Bo: if it was my larp I'll just kick them out and ban them from other events right after the first night of this shit
Steve: totally
Bo: And that was another thing I have a problem with - the organizers just weren't assertive enough with them. If a player ruins the game for everyone else you just kick him or her out, simple as that
Steve: You can always give them feedback about all this
Bo: I already did, cause they obviously put a lot of effort into this and just have to fix some things until next year. "

Tony: Don't forget the tortillas!
Lisa: Okay, I don't have the chipotles, but regular jalapenos will do. And instead of tortillas, he'll get plain bread.
Ruby: I think that'll do.
Lisa: How much time do I need?

Louise: Fine! How did the 18th go, I bet they all had a fab time!
Sue: Don't mention birthday parties to me! I am absolutely fucking livid with my daughter and so is Pete!
Louise: What has Lara done now! Just teen hijinx, is it!?
Sue: No, indeed! It started off ok as we booked the village hall for the right day and almost everyone she invited was able to come. 
Louise: Yes, it's unusual to get teenagers to reply to invitations! Did you stay for the night?
Sue: No, she begged us not to come! We set everything up, decs, drinks etc, nice buffet, but then we made ourselves scarce, we only live on the next street, you see. We decided to pop back in a few hours. That was very naive of us, to be honest!
Louise: I'm guessing things didn't actually go smoothly!
Sue: Understatement of the year! Pete went back round about 11.00 and there was utter carnage! There was vomit and spilled drinks everywhere, the front window had been smashed, the bathroom door had come off it's hinges and the mother and toddler toys and books were ripped and strewn about all over the place. Pete roared at Lara and turned the music off. Nobody moved at first, but he threatened to call the police!
Louise: Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I bet she was thoroughly embarrassed.
Sue: No, not really. About 8 of her friends were sleeping at our house, so they all crashed back there sheepishly.
Louise: Yes, but next day, she must have apologised to you.
Sue: She did not! In fact, around 6 of the group came back to the Hall to help clean up, but Lara refused to get out of bed!
Louise: I can't believe she acted so selfishly! 
Sue: We've made her pay for the damage out of her part time job at the vets and also refused to pay for one of her holidays. 
Louise: Yes, you did right! So she's got more than one holiday?
Sue: Yes, three! One she paid for herself, mind. She's still hardly speaking to us and it was 2 weeks ago. 
Louise: So sorry you've had to go through this, Lara needs to step up here, though!
Sue: I know, I think she'll come round. I have a feeling someone sneaked some drugs in and it made a few of them go apeshit! Hope Lara didn't have any.
Louise: I'm sure things will improve. Come and see us all next weekend. Lara loves to see Steve, he's like her little brother. 
Sue: Yes, I'd love that! See you soon!
Louise: Bye."

Resa: Not so bad here! Maybe slightly warmer than average but rarely above 30. Very pleasant indeed.
Resa: If you were staying with us, I image you'd be in the pool all the time.
Carol: Sure I would. Are you?
Resa: No. You know me.
Resa: Bill saw the ENT doc today. He will have an MRI scan soon to determine if he has growths on the ear nerves.
Carol: What?! What does it mean?
Carol: Any suspicion of spreading????
Resa: No, the doc says these are usually benign.
Carol: Thank goodness for that.
Resa: And slow growing, but the damage to the nerve is the issue.
Carol: Has he got any hearing problems?
Resa: I'm frustrated because everything Bill has suffered from, I've asked him to seek medical attention and he's declined. So he's suffering now (and am I) from lack of preventive care.
Carol: Typical male. Thomas is not different.
Carol: Of course the partner suffers along, sometimes even more.
Resa: So true...
Resa: It's bad Carol. We cannot hold a decent conversation. He can no longer watch television.
Carol: That really sounds awful. So sorry for you.
Carol: And what about hearing aids? Also refused??
Carol: But he loved television so much!
Resa: Another challenge to deal with.
Resa: Hearing aid will come once the cause of deafness is diagnosed.
Carol: My mother in law had a pair of earplugs connected to the TV set via Bluetooth, so she could walk around her room and still hear tv.
Carol: I mean the technology is there to grab it.
Resa: Yes, that's  a fantastic option.

Martha: Those are the two turkeys that have been pardoned. 
Robert: Tell me more, 'cause I think I don't know what's the fuss about.
Martha: Every year the US President pardons turkeys for Thanksgiving.
Robert: Y? 
Martha: Just a tradition.   
Robert: Oh, right! It's Thanksgiving time! How are you spending it?
Martha: With my family. As every year we'll go to our cottage by the lake and have Thanksgiving dinner there.
Robert: Wow! Sounds fun. So do you leave afterwards of stay there?
Martha: Depends. If my parents have to go to work, then we leave the same day. Usually, though, we have a short vacation.
Robert: So what do you do there?
Martha: If the weather's nice, we go for a swim in a boat or do some hiking. Nature there is absolutely fantastic!
Robert: Wow! I envy you! But like really envy!
Martha: Y?
Robert: 'cause I don't get to spend Thanksgiving like that. 
Martha: What do you do? Sorry for not asking.
Robert: Not much to tell. Usually, there's the feast my whole family comes to and at some point, someone starts talking about something controversial. 
Martha: Controversial? Like what?
Robert: Idk. Abortion, politics, religion, you name it.
Martha: And then y'all start arguing?
Robert: More or less. My aunt usually shouts and my other uncle can get a bit handsy if he's had one too many.
Martha: Geez. That's horrible.
Robert: The worst part is that everyone is angry with everyone else and we don't talk to one another for months.
Martha: I'm sorry. Really.
Robert: Nah. Got used to it."

Barbabas: Is everything alright at home?
Selma: old aircraft?
Barbabas: Just the opposite! We flew to Cancun in some old lemon and it was roomy as in the good old days. This flight was on a brand new airbus, with seats squeezed and small as for kids. Scandalous, if you ask me.

Rose: Isn't Turkey a bit... dangerous?
Hannah: I've heard there's a war in Turkey
Sophie: War? Who told you that?
Hannah: It's all over the news
Sophie: I don't know what kind of news you're listening to ;) I'm all up for Turkey. Where exactly would we go?
Janet: First of all, there isn't any war in Turkey. Second, it's not dangerous, MFA says it's even less dangerous than France
Rose: But is it really? I'm not sure, I'd prefer to go to Europe
Sophie: Turkey is also in Europe ;)
Janet: We'd go to the west part of the country, which is known to be more modern and European. Also, it's very touristy, so I don't think it's dangerous
Rose: I love the programme Janet, but I'm not really sure... I'll think about it
Sophie: Count me in. I've been to Turkey numerous times and loved it - I haven't been to western part, so it sounds great! Will there be any additional trips?
Janet: I believe so. The office is still preparing a separate offer for us
Hannah: It seems like a good idea. Like Rose I'm not so sure about Turkey, but if Sophie says it's nice...
Sophie: <file_photo>
Sophie: Look how beautiful it is! Come on girls, we'll go there to work out!
Janet: That's the spirit Sophie! I've been there couple of times, I checked the hotel and it's good standard, very pleasant place
Rose: Ok, I'll let you know as soon as possible. When's the deadline?
Janet: I need to complete the list at the end of this month, so there's still time - unless I get enough participants before that date. There are only 20 places ;)

Sasha: but I'm really into him

Rob: I can't remember anything. Panel blackout! ‚ö´
Hugh: Any annoying questions from the audience?
Rob: ‚ö´
Hugh: lol
Clarice: Well, I don't know what the guys think but I personally think the guy who chaired Rob's panel was a little bit of a dickhead, wasn't he?
Rob: üî¥ Yeah, a total dick. He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.
Clarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual
Hugh: Fuck, sounds insane
Juan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the ""question"" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority üíñ
Hugh: Ha ha ha how so
Clarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face
Juan: Sounds like a nice prelude üéº
Rob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Clarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...
Rob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval
Juan: Sounds really bizarre... So Rob, what's History? What's Literature? What's Art?
Rob: Oh fuck off lol

Jake: Gosh! True! We'll talk about it. Now we have to get Pa thru' this medical thing. You have to! I had an impression talking to him yesterday that he prefers you to be present rather than me or Lawrie. Fair enough!
Mia: That's because we visited all those doctors together before. I simply have a good understanding of his condition. And I've also coordinated all his appointments. No worries - nothing personal.

Rob: I think I should buy a number - such as 0333 and then redirect it to your mobile, which will redirect if no one answers (I think you can set that up on your mobile?)
Rob: We can then measure how many CS notepads call us and adjust the monthly package accordingly
Ann: Possibly as the main company number yes, but with my mobile number to call direct in office hours or text out of hours as they may not like calling a 03 number and getting replies from a strange mobile
Rob: possibility
Ann: Its worth just trying the mobile number at the moment maybe.  Does the 0333 number you have already belong to CS? Why can you not keep that number and just redirect calls from that?
Rob: 0333 numbers are mobile friendly, like 0800 numbers. I dont fancy adding a mobile on the site as it makes us look too small. I want people to think they are dealing with a larger business
Ann: Ahh Yes I didn‚Äôt think of that, it will be ok on my emails though? Rather than the skype one?  I do have a landline number that only gets used once in a blue moon, but that has a Gloucester code, I‚Äôm happy for you to use that  if that could be of use
Rob: Im setting up a new 0333 number - what is your mobile number?
Ann: That‚Äôs a very good question because until I get the phone unlocked I cant call to see what the number is and as I never used it myself
Ann: I ve been paying 5 a month for the last year but not used it.  So I will get it to you asap, I am going over to Tesco shortly and I can get it unlocked there hopefully tonight

13729808,"Joan: Hello dear, didn't see you in church today!
Jean: Oh, well, my back is playing me up, I think it's sciatica again!
Joan: Oh no! Not again! Tom had that, he was in pain for weeks.
Jean: Well, it's not too bad at the moment, I've got some of Donald's painkillers just in case.
Joan: Now you be careful, check they haven't expired.
Jean: No, they're fine, he has loads!
Joan: Don't become an opiate addict will you, darling?
Jean: I'm not that stupid! I am very careful with medicines, you do remember that we were both nurses for 40 bloody years, don't you!
Joan: Yes, of course, but I know that when you're in pain it's easy to self-medicate and overdo it. Perhaps you should go to the Dr.
Jean: Maybe, if it gets worse, they're busy enough with real problems.
Joan: Well, just take care, that's all. How are Maisy, Harry and the kids?
Jean: Well, the two oldest have just started secondary and Idris hates it! The little ones are still in primary, getting on well, it seems. Harry may have to move to Scotland, though.
Joan: Oh, that's so far away, let's hope not!
Jean: Yes, but it's lots more money, so he is considering it seriously.
Joan: Well, I'm sure it'll work out for the best. Did Stella call in? 
Jean: Yes, after church, she came in snooping to see why I didn't turn up, nosy bitch!
Joan: Well, since Ken died she's lonely and wants to chat even more, she doesn't come up for air!
Jean: You're telling me! She stayed for almost 3 hours, I had to tell her I had to go to bed to rest my back, couldn't get rid of her otherwise!
Joan: I'm the same, I do try and dodge her at church if possible, but she often seeks me out and I'm stuck for the whole morning, she insists on going to the Church Hall for coffees.
Jean: Perhaps we should try to find her a new husband! Your brother's a widower, isn't he? 
Joan: Bloody Nora! Can you imagine having Stella as your sister in law! No, I don't think Bill will be up for that!
Jean: Anyway, must go start dinner, see you next Weds, hopefully, back permitting.
Joan: Rest yourself now, lovely. See you soon!"
